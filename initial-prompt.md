I've created this repository as a scratch pad and brainstorming zone to reimagine my studio to solve workflow and routing challenges, and to brainstorm software that I might write for the Raspberry Pi.

When I initially purchased the Raspberry Pi, I had been contemplating purchasing the midihub. I really wanted to be able to press a single note on my bi-timbral Novation Summit synthesizer and for the result to be either a droning bass or a bass playing an arpeggiated pattern in one timbre. The arpeggiated chord would adhere to whatever key and mode is set, for example if "ionian C" was set, a C note would trigger C major triad arpeggiated, a D note would trigger D minor, etc.

However, that project never got off the ground.

Before we dive back into building THAT project, please help me think outside the box: what tools, workflows, connectivity, and controls for live-tweaking my music might I consider?

The Force by itself has powerful macro midi controls that can have one knob sending
The con to that approach is that the interface is somewhat clunky; we may be able to program friendlier mappings using rPi.

I brought in the manual for the Drop /Users/ethan.stark/dev/misc/audio-midi/claude_docs/CLAUDE.md because it seems like such an innovative product, and reverse-engineering some of its functionality using my hardware may be a future project for me.

While I may perform live in the future, I don't currently have a specific plan to; this is a hobby project.
