# Reference manuals

Two device manuals are included in `claude_docs/` as LLM-friendly text.

- Neuzeit Instruments DROP Manual v1.07
  - Preferred: `claude_docs/drop_chunks/` (smaller chunks)
  - Full: `claude_docs/drop.md`

- Akai Force User Guide v3.3
  - Preferred: `claude_docs/force_chunks/` (smaller chunks)
  - Full: `claude_docs/force.md`

Usage guidance for Claude Code:
- Search within `claude_docs/**` for the relevant keyword first.
- Open the *smallest* chunk that contains the topic.
- Quote the page numbers shown in headings (e.g., “Page 123”) when answering.

Tip: Avoid always @-including the full manuals in every run; use chunks on-demand.
