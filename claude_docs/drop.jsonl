The benefit of using the included 12V power supply is that you still have both\nUSB-C ports available to connect other gear. It is also the best choice to suppress audible noise caused by ground loops.\nPower input: 12V DC, 1200 mA min\nwhat Drop requires when powered via external power supply\nUSB1 input:\n5V DC,   1500 mA min\nwhat Drop requires when powered via USB1\nUSB1 output: 5V DC,   1500 mA max\nwhen Drop is used as USB host to power other gear via USB (automatic host role detection)\nUSB2 output: 5V DC,   500 mA max         when Drop is used as USB host to power other gear via USB (automatic host role detection)\nIf you are using USB-C, you must use the USB1 port with the little flash symbol next to it. You also need a USB-C-to-C connection and your USB host\nmust be able to supply at least 1500mA. Computer USB-C ports usually can supply twice as much current.\nOnly USB-C to USB-C cables in conjunction with a USB-C host or power supply can be used to power Drop. USB-A cables and USB-A power\nsupplies will NOT work for power, even if the power supply meets the electrical requirements. The USB-A socket does not allow the necessary\npower negotiation between Drop and power supply.\n\n7\nWorks for powering from USB-C\nhost with min 1500mA output\nDoes not work for powering\nWorks for powering, if\nmin 1500mA output\ncurrent\nDoes not work for\npowering, no matter\nhow much current out\n\n[Page 8]\nConnectivity\nDrop can control up to eight other MIDI devices with\nits user interface. Drop features 2x USB and 4x TRS\nMIDI ports, so that each device benefits from its own\nconnection, providing full data bandwidth and its own\nclock signal with individual micro-delay.\nIn this example...\nThe laptop (DAW  only offers USB connections, so it is\n)\n\nobvious to connect it via USB. The laptop may also\npower Drop via its USB1 port.\nThe SEQUENCER may send a lot of MIDI data, so it\nmay be a good choice to connect it via USB. Also,\nDrop can eventually power the sequencer via USB.\nIncoming MIDI, e.g. from KEYBOARD, GROOVEBOX,\nDAW, SEQUENCER, SYNTH A, can be distributed to\nother devices using Drop s\n’ Device Merger function.\nDrop s MIDI\n’\nIn and Out ports are not related to each\nother and can be used for different devices, like\nKEYBOARD and SYNTH D in this example.\nIt is still possible to connect devices in classic daisychain cabling, using MIDI Thru, like SYNTH A and B.\nDrop s two\n’\nCV inputs and outputs are mostly used for\nclock and timing. The outputs can also be variable 05V control voltages 12-bit DAC .\n(\n)\n8\n\n[Page 9]\nUSB, TRS, CV pros and cons\nUSB-MIDI:\nHigh data rate, not so precise with MIDI clock timing. Requires class-compliant MIDI gear if Drop is used as USB host.\nTRS-MIDI:\nLow data rate, but mostly sufficient, especially when each device has its own cable carrying only the device s data. Precise clock timing.\n’\nCV:\nOn Drop, same clock timing precision as TRS-MIDI.\n2x USB-C\nUSB MIDI\nConnect laptops or class-compliant MIDI devices to Drop. With USB, there is always host and device role to be negotiated. Drop will automatically\ndetect which mode is necessary and can also act as a MIDI host for other controllers and instruments. In MENU > Settings, you can switch the mode\nfor each port from Host + Device  auto-detection to Device Only . As a MIDI host, Drop can supply 5V on each port to power the connected\n“\n”\n“\n”\ndevice. USB1 can supply up to 1500mA and USB2 up to 500mA. The specs are also printed on Drop s bottom side. You can also use the included\n’\nUSB-C to USB-A adaptor if your device requires an oldschool USB-A/B cable.\nUSB-hubs are not supported, so you can only connect one USB device per port.\nTo connect to MIDI devices via USB, your device must be class-compliant. This means, that no driver needs to be installed to use it, which applies to\nmost gear out on the market. However, some manufacturers e.g. Roland  still require a driver for their USB-MIDI gear. To use their devices with\n(\n)\nDrop, you need to use the classic MIDI TRS/DIN connection. Drop will show you a popup message if the USB gear connected is not class-compliant.\nUSB keyboard\nConnect a USB computer keyboard for navigation and to name devices, controls and\nsnapshots.\nIn Menu > Settings, select the approriate layout e.g.\n(\nQWERTY, QWERTZ, AZERTY .)\nNavigation = Arrow keys, Escape, Enter, Backspace.\nChange slot = Shift + Arrow keys\nCTRL+9 = MENU button\nCTRL+0 = PLAY button\nCTRL+1-8 = Buttons around the display, clockwise\n9"}

Four ports enable you to connect one device per port in a star-topology instead of daisy\nchaining the MIDI signal from device to device. The star-topology enables high data throughput and individual MIDI clock delays per device.\nUse the small switches on the back to select TRS type A or B for Drop s MIDI output. If you pick the wrong mode, your device may not receive\n’\nMIDI data from Drop.\n2x CV out\nDrop s CV inputs and outputs support a voltage range between 0,0 and 5,0 Volts.\n’\nThe outputs can be used independently to send different kinds of clock signals, triggers and gates to sync analogue gear. They can also be used as a\nsimple continuous voltage outputs that can be assigned to any of Drop s controls. The resolution is 12 bits 4096 steps .\n’\n(\n)\n2x CV in\nUse CV inputs 1 and 2 to connect Drop to an external analogue clock source. CV1 expects the clock signal 16\n(\nth or 8th notes  and CV2 can be\n)\nconfigured to receive a dedicated start and stop trigger or gate signal.\nThere is also another mode available that lets you use the CV1 and 2 inputs to fire snapshots from external modular gear, where CV In 1 receives\ntriggers and CV In 2 receives a control voltage to select a snapshot. You can enable this mode in the CV Config menu.\nIf you are planning to control your modular rack with Drop, we recommend to use a dedicated MIDI-to-CV-out converter module.\n10\n\n[Page 11]\nStep-by-step workflow\n1  Decide which gear to use\n)\nBefore getting into Drop, you should have an idea of what kind of setup you want to build and what gear you want to connect to Drop. Ideally, you\nalready have your grooveboxes or synths play a loop, and now it is time to create an accessible user interface for them on Drop.\n2  Init your project\n)\nSelect Project > Clean Init. You now have an empty project that does absolutely nothing  the perfect starting point for a\n–\nsetup with hardware gear,\nwhere mapping is all done in Drop.\nFor a DAW-only setup, Project > DAW Init is a one-click init option that applies a default mapping to Drop, so that every control element sends out a\ndefault CC message over USB1. From there, you can map everything in your DAW. You can skip steps 3 and 4.\n3  Create and configure devices\n)\nGo to the Devices menu and add the devices you want to use in your live set up to 8 devices max . Even if your device uses multiple MIDI channels,\n(\n)\nyou only need to list it as one device in Drop. Also hook up keyboards and sequencers that merge their data with Drop s data and send it out to\n’\nother connected gear. You should also configure clocks in this step.\n4  Mapping on Drop\n)\nEach of Drop s controls can send out up to 8 different MIDI messages with different curves which allows flexible macro mapping. Each control offers\n’\n8 Slots to set up different kind of MIDI messages. This is an essential and powerful feature to create a user interface that speaks across multiple\ndevices in your setup.\nUse the Mapping menu to configure the controls you want to use. Depending on your target device, you can either enter the MIDI parameters by\nhand, use MIDI Learn, or use the included MIDI CC and NRPN database if it contains your target device.\n5  Snapshots\n)\nBy now, you should have developed a feeling for your newly created user interface. It is time to create some snapshots! These can either be fallback\nsafety net points, peak moments, snapshots that only affect a subset of controls so you can combine them later, a fixed chain of snapshots that\nfollow your song s arrangement, or you simply skip snapshots and use them spontaneously on stage as save-and-recall points.\n’\n11\n\n[Page 12]\nPLAY view\nBeatjump\nThis view controls and shows the playback position\ninside the current cycle. Use the eight buttons around\nthe display to jump to another playback position while\nplaying.\nNote: Performing a beatjump also sends a Song Position message to all devices, that have the according\ncheck mark set in the clock menu.\n\n12\nCurrent playback position\nHere: bar nr 7 quarter note 3\nCurrent Jump fade time\nChanges its length depending on the fade\ntime potentiometer. If you push a snapshot in\nJump mode right now, this is the time it needs\nto fade to it.\nBlinking cycle button\nNo matter which menu you are in,\nthe corresponding button will always\nblink so you always know the\nplayback position\nCycle end = Drop time\nThe 12 o clock position marks the start and end of a cycle. It also marks\n’\nthe time when a snapshot in Drop mode is executed.\nMIDI traffic monitor\nTRS 1-4 output\nTRS 1-4 input\nUSB 1-2 output\nUSB 1-2 input\ndark green\n= only clock and system data\ngreen\n= data\nlight grey\n= no traffic\nred\n= data overflow, lose packets\ndark grey\n= nothing connected\nblue\n= USB keyboard connected\nFlash symbol = USB port serves as host, delivers\n5V power to the connected device.\nChange the playback position\nPush the eight cycle buttons to change the playback\nposition.

Some USB devices offer multiple\ninternal Sub-Ports for communication. Sub-Port 1 works just fine for most USB gear.\nIf communication to your USB device fails and it offers more than one Sub-Port, try another one.\nUnfortunately, sub-ports are often not documented in the device s user manual. You simply\n’\nhave to try.\nFor the nerds: The Sub-Port corresponds to the cable number CN in the USB MIDI protocol. Sub-ports are also reffered to as virtual cables.\nNote: In the clock menu, you can specify to which sub-ports clock and transport messages are being sent.\nGear with MIDI mapping table - Synths and grooveboxes\nEnable MIDI Output, and only enable MIDI Input if needed: For example, if the device can send MIDI data back to Drop when turning its knobs, you\ncan use convenient MIDI Learn for mapping. You should also enable the MIDI Input, if the device includes a MIDI sequencer or a keyboard whose\nnotes you want to forward to other connected devices.\nGear for MIDI Input only - Keyboards\nUsually there is no need to enable MIDI Output, picking only a MIDI Input port is sufficient. To setup MIDI forwarding to another device, use the\ntarget device s MERGER function, described on the following pages.\n’\nGear with own MIDI mapping - DAWs and workstations\nGenerally, you should enable both, MIDI Input and Output, and do the mapping on your DAW or workstation. You might also prefer USB over TRS\nMIDI. Usually, DAWs and workstations offer their own internal MIDI Learn function and parameter mapping. Use MENU > Project > DAW Init to\nquickly apply a default initialization for use with a DAW.\n16\nExample: This is how a synth with two USB\nsub-ports shows up in Ableton Live.\n\n[Page 17]\nProgram Change Pre-Delay\nThis is a useful feature for grooveboxes that need to receive program\nchange messages just a little bit before their internal sequencer s pattern ends.\n’\nLet s assume, you schedule a snapshot in Drop mode fires at the end of a cycle  and that snapshot contains\n’\n(\n)\n\na program change message to tell your groovebox to switch to the next pattern. The groovebox may need\nto know about the pattern change a little earlier, just before the pattern ends, so it has some\ntime left to prepare everything for the pattern change. This is what we call a pre-delay. You can select from\ndifferent values, like a fixed number of milliseconds or tempo-dependent values like 3/16th notes.\nYou want the Program Change Pre-Delay to be as small as possible and as large as necessary.\nSequencer-based devices (grooveboxes) may need a time-related value like 3/16th notes, while synths\nmay need a fixed amount of time to load a new preset.\nYou simply have to try out which pre-delay value works best for your device.\nDatabase\nDrop ships with the open-source MIDI CC & NRPN database from Pencil Research on its SDcard. This database contains mapping tables of popular MIDI gear and simplifies the mapping process.\nNavigate through the database and check if your device is supported. If so, selecting it can make mapping\nmore convenient.\nThe database can be found on https://github.com/pencilresearch/midi\nTo get the latest version of the database, simply open the link on your computer, click on the green button\nCode > download ZIP. Then extract the folder on your computer and move it into the root folder of Drop s’\nSD-card. The database folder must be named /midi-main which is the default name the database already\nhas when downloading it.\n17\nNavigate through the CC & NRPN mapping\ndatabase and check if your device is included.\n\n[Page 18]\nDevices Merger\nDrop s MIDI merger allows you to forward MIDI input data to a\n’\n\nMIDI output. You can even modify incoming data before it gets\nforwarded, like transposing MIDI notes.\nUse case:\nYou want to control your synth by Drop s controls, but it should\n’\n\nalso receive notes from a MIDI keyboard. However, your synth\nonly has one MIDI-In port. This means, the MIDI data from Drop s’\ncontrols must be merged together with the MIDI data from the\nkeyboard.\n18\nExample: Merging a MIDI sequencer, a keyboard and Drop s control elements to\n’\na synth. Notes can be transposed by Drop s control elements along the way.\n’"}

But first things first\n There are two main categories of MIDI receiving\n…\ndevices that you should be aware of.\nDevices with fixed mapping table synths, grooveboxes\n(\n)\nMost synths and grooveboxes offer a MIDI mapping table in their manual, which is a list of device parameters e.g. volume, cutoff frequency, etc.\n(\n)\nthat can be remotely controlled via MIDI. The device expects a specific MIDI message e.g. CC message #13 value range 0-127  per parameter and\n(\n)\nyou need to configure your MIDI sender Drop  to transmit exactly that message in order to control that parameter.\n(\n)\nFor devices with a fixed MIDI table, it is best practice to start off with an empty project and populate Drop s controls bit by bit.\n’\nThis kind of mapping can be quite a bit of work. Therefore, Drop offers different ways to help you get through this process as fast as possible.\n•\nLook up the MIDI mapping table of your synth and manually enter the MIDI message type, numbers, value ranges on Drop.\n•\nYour device can send MIDI out when you turn its knobs? Great! You can use MIDI learn on Drop which significantly speeds up the mapping\nprocess. First, ensure your device actually sends MIDI data often, this must be enabled in its settings  and connect the device s MIDI out to\n(\n)\n’\nDrop s MIDI in, so that communication works in both directions. Also ensure that in Drop s Device settings, you enabled and selected the\n’\n’\ncorresponding MIDI input. On Drop, you can go to PLAY > Monitor to check and verify the incoming and outgoing messages.\n•\nIf your device is listed in the Pencil Research MIDI database on Drop s SD-card, you can select the device parameter from the database. This is\n’\na convenient alternative to look up the parameter name in the device s manual and entering the MIDI control parameters by hand on Drop.\n’\n22\nExample of a typical MIDI mapping table, taken from the\nElektron Rytm MK1 manual\n\n[Page 23]\nDevices with MIDI learn DAW, workstations\n(\n)\nSoftware DAWs e.g. Ableton Live  or hardware workstations e.g. Akai MPC series  have so many parameters that it is just too many for a fixed\n(\n)\n(\n)\nmapping table. Instead, they offer a MIDI-Learn function to map parameters to incoming MIDI messages. For the DAW, it doesn t matter which\n’\nspecific MIDI message your controller sends, as long as it is a unique message per control.\nGo to Project > DAW Init to quickly apply a default mapping to use Drop with a DAW. This function sets MIDI messages to each of Drop s control\n’\nelements at once, so that each control element sends out a different MIDI CC or MIDI note message.\n23\nExample of MIDI mapping in a DAW (Ableton Live)\n\n[Page 24]\nControl element configuration\nNavigate to MENU > Mapping and turn, push, move the control element you want to configure.\nOn the first pages of the mapping menu, you can define the overall look and behavior of the control\nelement.\nActive\nTurn the control element on or off. If you re-activate a control element, it still remembers\nits settings from before.\nColor\nDrop offers 9 colors for its control elements that are easy to distinguish from each other.\nName\nYou can name the control element. This makes it easier for you to get back at your live set\nafter a longer time if color coding is not enough to get used to it again. When you move a control\nelement, its name is displayed on the screen when in PLAY view. You can disable this in the settings.\nBehavior\nDescribes the physical behavior of the control element. It is different, depending on the\ntype of control element.\nRotary knob turn\nPrecision\nSlow turning speed for precise adjustments.\nDynamic Pot\nEmulates potentiometer behavior, so that the physical position corresponds to the LED ring. When turning\nslowly, precise adjustments are possible, though.\nDynamic Fast\nSensitive to manual movement. When turning slowly, precise adjustments are still possible, though.\nRotary knob push\nToggle\nPressing the rotary knob functions as a separate MIDI button. Each push alternately sends the MIDI min or\nmax value and turns the button on or off.\nTemporary\nPressing the rotary knob functions as a separate MIDI button. When pressed, the MIDI maximum value is sent;\nwhen released, the minimum value is sent. Use this setting with a DAW that sends MIDI feedback to Drop.\nQuick Turn\nWhile pressed, the turning knob speed is 4x faster.\nReset Left/\nCenter/Right\nResets the rotary to its left/center/right position when pressed.\n24"}

Choose from different LED ring styles.\nRotary knob turn\nLine from left\nFor 0-100% unidirectional values.

In this mode, the rotary knob\n“\n”\ndoes not send its internal absolute position, but instead only its relative change if it is turned left or right. Your\ntarget application may require relative MIDI data for scrolling through DAW clip scenes or a file list in a\nbrowser. In such cases, the internal value of the rotary knob is also irrelevant, so we don t need to show it.\n’\n25\n\n[Page 26]\nDrop Prio\nWhen the control element is used in a snapshot that is fired in Drop mode, you can\nselect Normal or PreDrop priority. This affects micro timing of MIDI messages in a Drop.\nNormal\nUse this by default. The MIDI output of the control element is sent right after the Drop.\nPreDrop\nThe MIDI output of the control element is sent right before the Drop and a second time\nright after the Drop.\nExample use case:\nThe control element is mapped to the kick drum Mute function of a groovebox. The groovebox runs its\nown internal sequencer. You also have a snapshot that re-enables the kick drum.\nWhen firing this snapshot in Drop mode, it musically releases the energy after a peak moment. With\nNormal priority, the MIDI message for Mute re-enable is sent an instant after the Drop moment, but it\nmight be just too late and we might miss out the first kick at the downbeat of the new bar.\nBy enabling PreDrop priority, the Mute enable message is sent additionally just before the Drop moment, which ensures the kick is enabled at the\ndownbeat of the next bar.\nCV Out link Shows, if a control element is mapped to the CV OUT 1 or 2 jack.\nYou can use the control elements not only to send out MIDI, but also to control the two CV outputs. The CV outputs may be configured as clock\nsignals, but they can also be used as simple variable linear voltage outputs in MENU > CV Config. There, you can also set the voltage range 0,0 to\n(\n5,0 Volts, 12-bit DAC .)\nThe actual linkage of a control element to a CV output is in MENU > CV Config.\nMerge link\nShows, if the control element is linked to any parameter in a Device Merger.\nYou can use the control elements not only to send out MIDI, but also to manipulate incoming MIDI data that passes through the Device Merger. The\nDevice Merger offers manipulation of incoming MIDI data before it is redirected to another device e.g. note transposition . The manipulation\n(\n)\nparameters can be mapped to Drop s control elements.\n’\nThe actual linkage of a control element to a Merger parameter is in MENU > Devices.\n26\n\n[Page 27]\nFeedback by MIDI-In\nDrop s control elements can not only send out MIDI data,\n’\n\nthey can also be remotely controlled by receiving MIDI, also\ncalled Feedback. You can enable MIDI feedback separately\nfor each control element.\nHowever, if you enable MIDI Feedback, it must always\ncorrespond to one of the slots for MIDI-Output. These are\nthe requirements:\n- The MIDI device linked to the slot must have a MIDI-Input\nport set in MENU > Devices.\n- Slot curve should be set to Linear, as incoming feedback\nmessages will also be mapped in a linear way back to the\ncontrol element s position.\n’\n- NRPN messages are not supported for MIDI feedback\nHardware gear usually does not send MIDI feedback when\nswitching programs/presets, as it would most likely cause\ntraffic overload. MIDI feedback is only sent when turning a\nknob on the device. This raises the question, if MIDI feedback\nis necessary for hardware gear at all. DAWs however offer\ngood support for MIDI feedback.\n27"}

This may help if you apply\nmapping on the target device (e.g. in a DAW).\n\n[Page 30]\nMIDI Learn\nDrop can listen to incoming MIDI messages, pick a message, and apply its parameters to a control element as outgoing MIDI message.\nThis is how it works: Some hardware devices can send MIDI on their output port when turning a potentiometer or changing a parameter. Usually, this\nis the same message type, channel and number which the device also expects as input to control the parameter.\nFirst, make sure the connected device actually sends MIDI output for parameter changes. Many devices require this option to be activated in their\nsettings first. Also, connect the MIDI output of your hardware device to one of Drop s MIDI inputs\n’\n, or use USB instead.\nWhen in MENU > Mapping, enter the slot you want to map and push the Learn button on the top right.\nNow, Drop shows live recording of incoming MIDI messages. On the device, move the parameter you want to map, and Drop should receive the\ncorresponding MIDI messages.

Snapshots enable you to automatically turn multiple control elements at once, which\nwould not be possible with only two hands. You can also execute multiple snapshots at once and combine them.\nIn addition, snapshots can also hold up to 8 MIDI messages that are being sent as one-shot messages when the snapshot is executed. These MIDI\nmessages can also contain program change and bank select messages to tell your devices to switch patterns or load the next preset.\nSnapshots can be recalled in Jump mode or in Drop mode, or both at the same time. In Jump mode, snapshots are executed with an adjustable fade\ntime, that can also be zero for immediate execution. In Drop mode, snapshots are scheduled in advance to be executed at the end of the current\nplayback cycle, which marks the point where the current 1-32 bar pattern ends and the next one begins. In Drop mode, execution takes place with\nno fade time, and also automatically ends ongoing Jumps, resulting in a timed and immediate change in music.\nWith this behavior, the combination of Jumps and Drops makes it easy to create a buildup followed by a sudden drop in music, by virtually turning\nparameters on up to eight hardware devices.\nYou can even go one step further and prepare sequences of Jumps and Drops in advance, using CHAIN mode. That way, you can prepare a song\narrangement using snapshots.

Manufacturers try to keep the latency as low as possible and if you play only one\ninstrument alone, you may not even notice. However, if you are running multiple devices in parallel,\ndifferent latencies may become audible.\nLeft   clock delay in milliseconds\n–\nThis delay time is independent of the tempo and counteracts audio processing time.\nRight   clock delay in MIDI clocks\n–\nOnly use this if you know what you are doing! Some DAWs and sequencers may not count the first\nMIDI clock packet, or also count the start message as a MIDI clock. Use this, to counteract such\nmisbehavior.\nStart off with all clock delays set to 0. Make sure, every device receives MIDI clock by Drop. Start playback and try to find out by ear if a device is\nconstantly playing a little bit ahead or after. It gets a lot easier if your devices play the same musical pattern, e.g. a short plucky sound every quarter.\nIf it is unclear, choose a reference device the one you expect to have the largest latency , let it play a pattern and unmute other devices one by one.\n(\n)\nIn our experience, hardware gear has very low latency in the 1-3 ms range. DAWs, however, can have significant and varying delay times, depending\non CPU load and audio settings.\nPositive delay times are preferred. You can also apply negative delay values. In this case, the clock will speed up a little bit after playback starts, until\nthe target pre-delay has been reached. So, playback will only be in sync after a short amount of time. For that reason, it is recommended to use\nnegative clock delays only when necessary.\n43\n\n[Page 44]\nSend MIDI clock while stopped\nIf this option is activated, Drop will send MIDI clock signal also while playback is stopped. This option\nshould be enabled unless it disturbs a connected device. Sending MIDI clock while being stopped is\ntypical groovebox behavior. It constantly updates the tempo information on the receiving device, and if\nthe receiving device is smart enough, you get better timing precision right after starting the clock.\nClock send enable\nOn the next page, you can enable MIDI clock, transport and song position pointer output for every\nphysical port separately.\nThe default setting with the two left checkmarks enabled is the right choice for most grooveboxes,\nsynths and DAWs send MIDI clock and transport .\n(\n)\nLeft   MIDI Clock\n–\nSends clock messages, which contain tempo information.\nMiddle  MIDI Transport\n–\nSends start and stop messages, telling the connected device so start/stop playback.\nRight  Song position pointer\n–\nSends song position pointer messages, telling the connected device the playback position within\nDrop s playback cycle. These messages are sent when performing a beatjump. If the receiving\n’\n\nsequencer supports it, it changes the playback position as well.\nNote: If linking another Drop in  MENU > Remote > Send, do not activate Song Position messages.\nClock to Sub-Ports of USB1/2\nMIDI via USB offers up to 16 virtual cables sub-ports .\n(\n)\nSome MIDI USB devices may offer more than one subport, but need to receive MIDI clock only on a specific\none. Therefore, you can select to which sub-ports clock,\ntransport and song position pointer messages are being\nsent and to which ones not.\n44\n\n[Page 45]\nCV Config\nDrop has two control voltage CV  inputs and outputs each that can be used in different ways. All four CV ports are designed for voltages from 0-5V.\n(\n)\n\nThe outputs can create continuous voltages with a resolution of 12 bits 4096 steps . The CV inputs can read analog voltages with a resolution of 16\n(\n)\nbits 65536 steps . To interface with a bigger modular system, you may want to use a Midi-to-CV converter\n(\n)\n\nmodule.\nCV OUT 1+2\nSignal\nLinked Control\nAssign any of the control elements directly to the CV output. Turning the\ncorresponding rotary knob or moving the fader linearly changes the CV output\nvalue between the Min and Max voltage range.\nTo assign a control element, select the Set Link option. Turn, push, move the\ncontrol element you want to assign. Use the clear option to remove the link.\n24/12/8/4/2\nPPQN Clock\nClock signal with the specified number of pulses per quarter note PPQN .\n(\n)\nEach pulse has a length of 5 ms.\n16th/8th/4th/1Bar\nClock 50%\nClock signal with the specified frequency. The PWM duty cycle is 50%.\nStart Trig\nOutputs a one-shot trigger when playback starts.\nIs Running Gate\nOutputs the Max voltage while playback is running, and Min when stopped.\nCycle Start Trig\nOutputs a trigger at the start of each cycle.\nCycle/Bar Pos CV\nOutputs a linearly rising voltage corresponding to the cycle/bar progress.\nJump Prog.\nRise/Fall\nOutputs a linearly rising/falling voltage corresponding to the progress within\nan ongoing Jump.\n45"}

You can link two or more Drops to jam with your band members and keep the same timing, or\nexpand the amount of available controls and connections, or use another MIDI device to control Drop s functions and embed it into a bigger setup.\n’\nJump by MIDI notes\nFire snapshots from an external MIDI source like a sequencer or a keyboard. Only the 4x5 snapshots of the current bank are affected. Snapshots are\nfired in Jump mode,  the fade potentiometer determines the fade time, and PLAY > Quantization is used for timing.\nMode\nOff\nIgnore notes.\nBy Pitch\nThe note number pitch  determines chooses the snapshot. The Base Note and the\n(\n)\n19 notes above are taken into account and are mapped to one snapshot each.\nNotes exceeding that range are cropped and treated like the base note or the\nhighest note which is base note + 20. The base note corresponds to the lower left\nsnapshot and the highest note to the upper right snapshot. If the incoming note\ndoes not exactly match a snapshot, the closest snapshot is selected.\nUse this mode to connect a programmable MIDI sequencer.\nVelo 1-20\nOnly the base note is taken into account, other notes do not fire a snapshot. Choose\nthe snapshot according to velocity values 1-20. If the incoming note has a velocity\nlarger than 20, it is cropped and treated as velocity = 20. Also here, velocity = 0\ncorresponds to the lower left and velocity >= 20 to the upper right snapshot.\nUse this mode to connect a programmable MIDI sequencer.\nVelo 1-127\nOnly the base note is taken into account, other notes do not fire a snapshot. The\nsnapshot is selected using the velocity value, where the full velocity range 1-127 is\nspread evenly across snapshots.\nUse this mode to connect a MIDI trigger pad played by hand.\n47\n\n[Page 48]\nReceive and Send\nMany of Drop s functions can be remotely accessed via MIDI CC messages. There are different levels of depth\n’\n\ntailored to real-world use cases that enable remote control.\nYou can use these settings to link two or more Drop units to play along.\nOn both Drops, you need to add a Device for the other connected Drop and select a MIDI out and a MIDI\ninput port. In MENU > Settings, you can enable Receive and Send independently and thereby have a master\nDrop. If both Drops should be able to set the remote parameters, you need to enable both Send and Receive\non both Drops. also make sure, that for each data direction, the MIDI channel is identical.\nYou still need to setup MIDI clock separately.\nJam Mode\nThe intended use case for this mode is playing a live set with a partner. Both have their own independent\nsetup with their own Drop as the master controller. Jam mode ensures that the Drop moment and the cycle\nplayback position are in sync across both setups. Besides that, each of you can play their own setup\nindependently.\nDual Mode\nChoose this mode to use a second Drop unit as an extension for more control elements and hardware ports.\nBy using this mode, the user interface and connectivity doubles in size. When selecting a Bank on the sender\nDrop, the receiver Drop will also switch the bank. Also, all snapshot related settings like quantization,\nexclusiveness, or the fade time potentiometer are overwritten on the receiver Drop by the sender Drop.\nFull Mode\nThis mode goes one step further than Dual mode, so when scheduling or firing a Snapshot on the sender, it also\nschedules and fires the same snapshot on the receiver Drop.\n48"}

Push the NEW+ button to create a new project or select an existing project name. Leave\nthe name as it is to overwrite the existing file or change the name to save a second version of the project.\nLoad Project\nSelect and load a project from the file system. Use the NEW+ button to start off with an empty project same as\n(\nClean Init .\n“\n”)\nRename Project Give an existing project a different name\nDelete Project\nDelete the selected project file from the SD card permanently. There is a safety step before the actual delete.\n59\n\n[Page 60]\nPurge Project\nHelps you clean up a cluttered project. There are several tasks available that can be turned on or off separately\nbefore proceeding. The purge function does not change the functionality of your project, it simply cleans up\nunused parts and re-sorts slots.\nReset unused devices\nThe parameters of devices that are not turned ON in MENU > Devices, will be reset to their initial\nstates. So if you turned on a device, changed some parameters, then turned it off again, the\nchanged parameters still persist in case you want to re-enable the device later. This function resets\nthe parameters of all devices that are not enabled.\nRe-sort device order\nIf there are gaps between active devices, active devices with higher slot numbers will be moved to\nlower slots, so that gaps are closed. E.g. if only devices 1, 3, 4, 7 are activated, they will be moved to\nslots 1, 2, 3, 4.\nRemove inactive controls\nChecks for each control element if it is active but does not have any MIDI mapping or any internal\nlink CV out or Merger assignment . If the control element is not actively used, it will be turned off\n(\n)\nand reset to its initial state.\nAlso snapshots are checked. If a snapshot is active but does not contain any data and does not have\nMIDI assigned, it will be turned off and reset to its initial state.\nReset unused slots\nGoes over all MIDI slots of all control elements and snapshots. If a slot is not used or has a mapping\nwhere the corresponding device is not active, the slot will be reset to its initial state.\nRe-sort slots\nGoes over all MIDI slots of all control elements and snapshots. If there are gaps between active slots,\nslots with higher numbers will be moved to lower slots, so that gaps are closed.\n60"}

Use DAW Init if your target device offers its own MIDI\nmapping function with MIDI learn, instead of having a fixed mapping table.\nDAW Init gives you just a starting point for a fresh project. You can change everything\nafterwards as usual.\nWhat DAW Init does on Drop:\n- Clears the whole project, including mappings, devices, snapshots, snapshot groups, etc.\n- Only one Device is activated, named DAW  and set to the USB1\n“\n”\nport by default.\n- All of Drop s\n’ control elements are activated. Slot 1 is used on each control element to send\na unique MIDI message to the DAW. CC and Note messages are being used on MIDI\nchannels 1 and 2.\n- Feedback by MIDI-In  is activated and assigned to Slot 1. Moving a mapped control in\n“\n”\n\nyour DAW also updates the control element on Drop.\nThere are a few options to customize DAW init.\nDevice\nDefines the device slot ID used for the DAW device.\nPort\nSelect the physical port for the DAW. If choosing TRS, make sure to connect Input and Output.\nColor Start\nSets the color of the first line or row or all control elements, depending on color mode.\nColor Mode\nSet a color scheme, e.g. Per Line, Per Column or Same Color.\nQuickturn\nActive:    The push function of all rotary knobs is set to Quickturn, no MIDI out.\nInactive:  Rotary push acts as a MIDI push button.\n61\n\n[Page 62]\nHardware Initialization\nClean Init\nUse this as a starting point for a setup with other hardware devices.\nWith this initialization function, all control elements and devices are deactivated\nand reset, so Drop s control surface will be dark at first.\n’\nThis is a clean starting point for a setup with devices with a MIDI mapping table.\nThis applies to most synths and grooveboxes, so the device expects a specific\nmessage for each parameter and all mapping is done in Drop. You should only\nactivate the control elements you actually need and set up the right MIDI\nmessages the receiving device expects.\nIf you have a MIDI device that has its own internal MIDI learn function, you should\nstill start off with an empty project. Then, just activate the needed controls and a\nMIDI slot and stick with the default unique message type and message number.\nThen, use the receiver s learn function.\n’\nStarting with a blank project is usually the best way to create a clean and\nreactive setup with no MIDI message overhead.\n62\n\n[Page 63]\nDefault mapping\nThis is the default mapping applied to each control element when using the functions Purge Project, Create New, DAW Init or Clean Init. Except from\nDAW Init, the control elements may be disabled, but the MIDI messages are already set up under the hood, so you only need to activate the control\nelement when you need it.\nPink\nMIDI CC message, channel 1.\nBlue\nMIDI Note message, channel 2.\nGreen MIDI Note message, example. Slots are deactivated and snapshots do not send out MIDI by default. But the note numbers are already set up\nin the background. Note numbers 0-119 are applied, repeating after bank 7 starting with note number 0 again.\nNote: Some CC numbers are missing (CC #0, #6, #32, #38, #97, #98) as they are used for NRPN and Bank Change messages. By skipping those\nnumbers, the mapping does not intersect.\n63"}
{"doc_title": "Neuzeit Instruments DROP Manual v1.07", "source_pdf": "Drop_Manual_v1_07.pdf", "page_start": 64, "page_end": 66, "text": "[Page 64]\nTroubleshooting\nSetting up Drop is all about making two MIDI devices talk to each other the right way. This may not always be straight forward, so this is a list of\ncommon pitfalls and tips.\nWhat messages does Drop actually send/receive?\nUse the MIDI Monitor in the PLAY view to see what messages are going in and out of Drop at each MIDI port. Drop keeps a history of the past\nmessages. You can stop recording and scroll through the history to see what is going on.\nMIDI TRS type A or B\nWhen using MIDI over TRS, there are historically two standards type A and B where the tip and the ring of the jack are physically switched. A\nreceiving device may only understand one of the two types. Drop has a switch next to each MIDI Output TRS port to select either type A or B.\nMIDI TRS to DIN adaptors also have one specific type A or B. If the wrong type is selected, the outgoing MIDI DIN signal does not work.\nDrop can receive both type A and B on its input. The switch only affects the outgoing signal.\nMIDI USB must be class-compliant\nWhen using a MIDI device over USB, communication only works if the connected device supports class-compliant MIDI. Unfortunately, this is not the\ncase for all MIDI devices. If your device needs a driver to be installed, it is not class-compliant and can not be used over USB with Drop. Use TRS MIDI\ninstead. During our tests, we found that some Roland and Boss devices do not support class-compliant MIDI.\nDrop may also show an error message and offer you to save a Log file. Before sending us the Log file, please double-check if the device really is\nsupposed to be class-compliant.\nUSB sub-port\nMIDI over USB uses sub-ports, also known as cable ID or virtual cable. The index ranges from 1 to 16. Per sub-port, another 16 MIDI channels can be\nsent. Most devices only use one cable ID, but some may also offer multiple ones. Make sure you set up the right one in MENU >Devices or simply try\nto find the one that works. The number of sub-ports the device offers is only shown when the MIDI device is connected.\n64\n\n[Page 65]\nMIDI channel\nMake sure the channel on which Drop sends MIDI messages corresponds to the channel on the receiving device. Drop uses channel numbering 1-16\nas the MIDI specification says. However, some devices may use a numbering scheme from 0-15 which is the actual data transmitted in the protocol.\nUSB hubs can not be used.\nUSB hubs are not supported by Drop. You can only use one direct USB connection from Drop to the device.\nMIDI port selection in  MENU > Devices\nThe MIDI Input and Output ports selected in MENU > Devices are simply the ports where your device is physically connected to and have nothing to\ndo with routing MIDI from device A to device B.\nIf you want to route incoming MIDI notes from a keyboard or sequencer to a synth, the synth does not necessarily need the MIDI Input port\nenabled. Instead, set up a second Device for the keyboard or sequencer and use the Merger function of the synth Device to set up the routing.\nYou only need to enable the MIDI Input port, if\n- your device is a keyboard or a sequencer\n- your device is a groovebox or synth that sends MIDI feedback when turning its knobs and you also want to use it in Drop\n- your device is a groovebox or synth that sends MIDI feedback when turning its knobs and you want to use MIDI Learn to set up the mapping.\nDo not ignore warnings\nThroughout all mapping and setup menus, Drop may show a !  warning sign wherever it detects a misconfiguration. For example, when a mapping\n“ ”\nis applied to a Device that does not have an output port set, a warning sign is shown. Warning signs usually mean, that messages are not being sent\nor received.\nEnable MIDI-Feedback only if really needed\nEach of Drop s control elements can react to incoming MIDI messages and be remotely turned, moved or pushed that way. The intention is that\n’\nwhen you turn the mapped control on the receiver, the mapped control element on Drop also changes its value.\nIf the control element uses more than one slot and also sends messages to other devices, these messages are also sent when MIDI feedback is\nreceived.\n65\n\n[Page 66]\nFor example: You macro-mapped a rotary knob to Synth-A s filter on Slot 1 and Synth-B s volume on Slot 2. The rotary knob s MIDI feedback is\n’\n’\n’\nenabled and set to Slot 1. Assuming that Synth-A sends back MIDI when turning its filter knob, the rotary control thereby changes its value. To avoid\na potential MIDI feedback loop, Drop will not respond by sending MIDI over Slot 1 on which it also receives incoming MIDI feedback from Synth-A,\nhowever it will still send MIDI out to Slot 2 so that Synth-B changes its volume.\nRemote TX and RX accidentally enabled\nDrop offers the option to be remotely controlled via MIDI which can be enabled in MENU > Remote. This function is also intended to link several\nDrop units, which is why Drop can also send the same MIDI messages out, such as the selected cycle length, quantization settings, beatjumps, and\nmany more. Besides that, incoming MIDI notes can be used to trigger snapshots remotely, e.g. from a MIDI keyboard or sequencer.\nOnly enable the Remote functions if you really need them, otherwise incoming MIDI messages may change settings in Drop without you even\nnoticing. The same way, Drop may send MIDI messages without intention.\nMIDI feedback loops\nA MIDI feedback loop is caused when a device receives a message which causes it to respond or pass it through and send another message back,\nwhich in turn causes the other device to also respond with a MIDI message again. By that, both devices end up sending messages back and forth in\na loop and the whole MIDI communication gets stuck. Loops can also occur across three or more devices.\nDrop already has some built-in features to prevent MIDI feedback, but it is still possible to create them.\nThere is no allround solution on how to prevent MIDI feedback loops, but the MIDI Monitor in the PLAY menu may help to find out what is going on.\nOptimize for performance\nIt is good practice to make sure only the messages which are actually needed pass through your cables. This reduces errors and improves latency.\n- Use the Merger s message filters and only enable what is actually needed.\n’\n- Send MIDI clock only to the ports and devices which actually make use of it. Also, double check if the receiving device needs and understands\nStart/Stop and Song Position messages and disable it when not needed.\n- Disable all control elements that are not used. If an unused control element is part of a snapshot, it will send unnecessary MIDI data when\nexecuting the snapshot.\n66"}
