Glossary

This glossary briefly defines and explains many of the technical terms used throughout this manual.

Aftertouch
The majority of contemporary keyboards are capable of generating aftertouch messages. On this
type of keyboard, when you press harder on a key you are already holding down, a MIDI aftertouch
message is generated. This feature makes sounds even more expressive (e.g., through vibrato).
Aliasing
Aliasing is an audible side effect arising in digital systems as soon as a signal contains harmonics
higher than half the sampling frequency.
Amount
Describes to which extent a modulation source influences a given parameter.
Amplifier
An amplifier is a component that influences the volume level of a sound via a control signal. It can
be modulated by a control signal (e.g., generated by an envelope or an LFO).
Attack
An envelope parameter. This term describes the ascent rate of a time-relevant process (e.g., an
envelope from its starting point to the point where it reaches its highest value). The attack phase
is initiated immediately after a trigger signal is received (e.g., after you play a note on a trigger pad
or a keyboard).
Bit Rate
Bit rate (also known as word length), is the number of bits used to store the level information of
each single sample slice within a whole sample. The higher the bit rate, the more precise the
information about a sample (i.e., its dynamics’ resolution). Normal audio CDs are 16-bit. The Force
hardware supports full 24-bit resolution.
Clip
A clip is a container for recorded audio or MIDI information. Clips that share a common type, such
as clips of a particular drum kit or plugin, are grouped into tracks. Clips across multiple tracks in
the same row are grouped into scenes.
Each MIDI clip contains MIDI note events and controller data. In this case, the clip contains no
audio information—only MIDI information that uses the samples in a track (or an external MIDI
sound module) to generate its audio. You can edit your performance in many different ways once
the performance has been captured.
Each audio clip contains an audio signal that has been recorded or imported into your project.
You can edit this audio within the software and incorporate it into your projects alongside your
MIDI clips.
Clipping
Clipping is a sort of distortion that occurs when a signal exceeds the maximum value that can be
handled by a signal processing system it is fed into. The curve of a clipped signal is dependent on
the system where the clipping occurs. In the analog domain, clipping effectively limits the signal to
a given maximum level. In the digital domain, clipping is similar to a numerical overflow, resulting
in negative polarity of the signal’s portions exceeding the maximum level.
Control Change
(Controllers)
MIDI messages enable you to manipulate the behavior of a sound generator to a significant degree.
This message essentially consists of two components:
•
The controller number, which defines the parameter to be influenced. It can range from 0
to 127.
•
The controller value, which determines the extent of the modification.
Controllers can be used for effects such as slowly swelling vibrato, changing the stereo panning
position and influencing filter frequency.
Cutoff
The cutoff frequency is a significant factor for a filter. A low-pass filter for example dampens the
portion of the signal that lies above this frequency. Frequencies below this value are allowed to
pass through without being processed.

CV
CV stands for control voltage, an analog method of sending control messages to external
synthesizers, drum machines, etc. CV messages are typically used in conjunction with Gate
messages (CV messages determine the pitch of notes while Gate messages determine note
activation and length). CV messages are sent from the CV out ports of your Force hardware and
to the CV in ports of your external device.
Please note that each external device uses a specific control voltage range, which determines how
many volts are used in each octave (e.g., 1V/oct). Be mindful of this when setting it up with the
Force software and/or controller hardware—mismatched voltage ranges can produce
unusual/undesirable “re-scaling” of the octaves.
Decay
Decay describes the descent rate of an envelope once the attack phase has reached its maximum
and the envelope drops to the level defined by the sustain value.
Envelope
An envelope is used to modulate a sound-shaping component within a given time. For instance,
an envelope that modulates the cutoff frequency of a filter opens and closes this filter over a period
of time. An envelope is started via a trigger, usually a MIDI note.
The classic ADSR envelope consists of four individually variable phases: attack, decay, sustain,
and release. Attack, decay and release are time or slope values, while sustain is an adjustable
level. Once an incoming trigger is received, the envelope runs through the attack and decay phases
until it reaches the programmed sustain level. This level remains constant until the trigger is
terminated. The envelope then initiates the release phase until it reaches the minimum value.
You can see and read about the envelopes used in Force in Operation > Modes > Track Edit
Mode > Anatomy of an Envelope.
Filter
A filter is a component that allows some of a signal’s frequencies to pass through it and dampens
other frequencies. The most important aspect of a filter is the filter cutoff frequency. Filters
generally come in four categories: low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and band-stop. These are
the available filters:
A low-pass filter (the most common type) dampens all frequencies above the cutoff frequency.
A high-pass filter in turn dampens the frequencies below the cutoff.
A band-pass filter allows only those frequencies around the cutoff frequency to pass. All others
are dampened.
A band-stop filter does the opposite of a band-pass: it dampens only the frequencies around
the cutoff frequency.
A band-boost filter boosts the frequencies around the cutoff frequency, similar to what a band
on an equalizer would do. All other frequencies pass through normally.
The number of poles in a filter’s “slope” determines how extreme or subtle the effect of the filter
will be. Filters with one or two poles produce a subtler sound while filters with six or eight poles
are much more pronounced.
The Model filters are analog-style emulations of famous vintage synth filters. Model1 is a fourpole filter that distorts at high input levels. Model2 uses a mellow resonance with a “fattening”
distortion in the lower frequencies. Model3 can produce howling, piercing resonances and
extreme sub frequencies—watch your speakers!
The Vocal filters are formant filters that emulate the human voice. Vocal1 produces “ah” and
“ooh” vowel sounds. Vocal2 uses three bands to produce “oh” and “ee” vowel sounds. Vocal3
uses five bands to emulate an idealized model of the vocal tract.
MPC3000 LPF is a dynamic, resonant low-pass filter (12 dB/oct) that was used on the original
MPC3000, released in 1994.
Please also see the entry for Resonance, an essential characteristic of a filter’s sound.
Gate
Gate messages are analog messages sent to external synthesizers, drum machines, etc. Gate
messages are typically used in conjunction with CV messages (CV messages determine the pitch of
notes while Gate messages determine note activation and length). Gate messages are sent from the
CV out ports of your Force hardware and to the CV/Gate in ports of your external device.

LFO
LFO is an acronym for low-frequency oscillator. The LFO generates a periodic oscillation at a
low frequency and features variable waveshapes. Similar to an envelope, an LFO can be used to
modulate a sound-shaping component.
MIDI
MIDI stands for musical instrument digital interface. Developed in the early 1980s, MIDI enables
interaction between various types of electronic music instruments from different manufacturers.
At the time a communications standard for heterogeneous devices did not exist, so MIDI was a
significant advance. It made it possible to link various devices with one another through simple,
standardized connectors.
Essentially, this is how MIDI works: One sender is connected to one or several receivers. For
instance, if you want to use a computer to play a MIDI synthesizer, the computer is the sender
and the synthesizer acts as the receiver. With a few exceptions, the majority of MIDI devices are
equipped with two or three ports for this purpose: MIDI In, MIDI Out and in some cases MIDI Thru.
The sender transfers data to the receiver via the MIDI Out jack. Data are sent via a cable to the
receiver’s MIDI In jack.
MIDI Thru has a special function. It allows the sender to transmit to several receivers. It routes the
incoming signal to the next device without modifying it. Another device is simply connected to this
jack, thus creating a chain through which the sender can address a number of receivers. Of
course, it is desirable for the sender to be able to address each device individually. To achieve
this, a MIDI channel message is sent with each MIDI event.
MIDI Channel
This is a very important element of most messages. A receiver can only respond to incoming
messages if its receive channel is set to the same channel as the one the sender is using to
transmit data. Subsequently, the sender can address specific receivers individually. MIDI
Channels 1–16 are available for this purpose.
MIDI Clock
The MIDI clock message transmits real-time tempo information to synchronize processes among
several connected devices (e.g., a sound generator’s delay time to a MIDI sequencer).
Modulation
A modulation influences or changes a sound-shaping component via a modulation source.
Modulation sources include envelopes, LFOs or MIDI messages. The modulation destination is a
sound-shaping component such as a filter or a VCA.
Note On & Note
Off
This is the most important MIDI message. It determines the pitch and velocity of a generated note.
A note-on message will start a note. Its pitch is derived from the note number, which can range
from 0 to 127. The velocity ranges from 1 to 127. A velocity value of 0 is equivalent to a note-off
message.
Normalize
Normalization is a function to raise the level of a sample to its maximum (0 dB) without causing
distortion. This function automatically searches a sample for its maximum level and consequently
raises the entire sample’s level until the previously determined maximum level reaches 0 dB. In
general, this results in a higher overall volume of the sample.
Panning
The process or the result of changing a signal’s position within the stereo panorama.
Pitch-Bend
Pitch-bend is a MIDI message. Although pitch-bend messages are similar in function to control
change messages, they are a distinct type of message. The resolution of a pitch-bend message
is substantially higher than that of a conventional controller message. The human ear is
exceptionally sensitive to deviations in pitch, so the higher resolution is used because it relays
pitch-bend information more accurately.
Program Change These are MIDI messages that select sound programs. Programs 1–128 can be changed via
program change messages.
Release
An envelope parameter. This term describes the descent rate of an envelope to its minimum value
after a trigger is terminated. The release phase begins immediately after the trigger is terminated,
regardless of the envelope’s current status. For instance, the release phase may be initiated
during the attack phase.

Resonance
Resonance or emphasis is an important filter parameter. It emphasizes the frequencies around the
filter cutoff frequency by amplifying them with a narrow bandwidth. This is one of the most popular
methods of manipulating sounds. If you increase the emphasis to a level where the filter enters a
state of self-oscillation, it will generate a relatively pure sine waveform.
Root Key
The root key defines the original pitch of a recorded instrument or of a sample. Samples in Force
contain the dedicated root key information. This information will be created automatically during
recording or importing.
Sample
When you tap the pads on your Force hardware, you can trigger sounds that we call samples.
Samples are digitized snippets of audio that can be recorded using the recording (sampling)
function of your Force hardware or loaded from the Browser.
You can edit and process a sample in different ways. For example, a sample can be trimmed,
looped, pitch-shifted or processed, using various effects. When you have finished editing your
sample, you can assign it to one or more drum pads to play it. Samples can be either mono or
stereo.
Sample Rate
This is the frequency representing the amount of individual digital sample scans per second that
are taken to capture an analog signal digitally. For normal CD audio recordings, 44100 samples
per second are used, also written as 44.1 kHz.
Scene
A group of clips in the same row.
Stretch Factor
The stretch factor is a value generated by the Warp algorithm in the software. When you record
an audio file, the current project tempo will be embedded with it. This information is stored within
the sample file when you save the project. When you warp an audio track region, the warping
algorithm uses this project tempo and the current value in the BPM field to generate the stretch
factor.
Sustain
This term describes the level of an envelope remaining constant after it has passed the attack and
decay phases. Once reached, the sustain level is kept until the trigger is terminated.
Time-Stretch
See Warp below.
Track
A project on your Force hardware can contain 128 MIDI tracks and 8 audio tracks.
Each MIDI track contains MIDI note events and controller data. In this case, the track contains
no audio information—only MIDI information that uses the samples in a drum track or keygroup
track (or an external MIDI sound module) to generate its audio. You can edit your performance in
many different ways once the performance has been captured.
Each audio track contains an audio signal that has been recorded or imported into your project.
You can edit this audio within the software and incorporate it into your project alongside your
MIDI tracks.
Trigger
A trigger is a signal that initiates events. Trigger signals are very diverse. For instance, a MIDI note
or an audio signal can be used as a trigger. The events a trigger can initiate are also very diverse.
A common application for a trigger is its use to start an envelope.

Warp
The Warp feature lengthens or shortens a region of an audio track or sample without changing its
pitch. This enables you to fit the length of an audio track or sample to the length of a clip, a bar
in your clip, etc. while maintaining its original key.
Please note that the Warp algorithms are very CPU-intensive and can result in audio drop-outs
during playback if used too freely. Be mindful of how (and how often) you use the warp function.
You can reduce the CPU resources required by doing any/all of the following:
Minimize the amount of pitch adjustment of warped audio.
In Track Edit Mode, avoid using extreme Stretch values.
Avoid warping very small audio regions.
Warp as few tracks or track regions as possible (i.e., reduce the number of total number of
voices of the polyphonic limit that use the Warp algorithm at a given time), especially
instances where the warped regions start at the same time.
Avoid rapidly triggering samples that are warped.
If you have warped samples used in a drum track or keygroup track, consider using the Flatten
Pad function to consolidate the affected pad’s layers into one audio sample (see here to learn
about this). After you flatten the pad, its sample/samples no longer need to be warped.

SATA Drive Installation

To create more internal storage space on your Force hardware, you can purchase a SATA (Serial ATA) drive and install it
yourself, but read this chapter first.
Your Force can support nearly any standard 2.5” SATA drive on the market—either a solid-state drive (SSD) or hard-disk
drive (HDD). Make sure it uses a 2.5” (63.5 mm) form factor and uses (or can use) one of these file systems: exFAT, FAT32,
NTFS, or EXT4 (for read and write capability) or HFS+ (for read-only capability).
Note: We recommend using an exFAT file system as it is the most robust one supported by both Windows and macOS.
Note: Alternatively, you could install an mSATA (mini-SATA) drive, but make sure you also purchase an adapter that
enables it to fit into a typical 2.5” SATA interface.

1. Make sure your Force hardware is powered off.
2. Locate the SATA drive panel in the center of the bottom panel of your Force hardware. Use a Phillips-head
screwdriver to remove the screws (don’t lose them!), and remove the SATA drive panel.
3. Gently pull the SATA connector and cable out from inside your Force hardware. Be careful not to disturb anything
inside—handle just the SATA connector and cable.
4. Connect your SATA drive to the SATA connector. Make sure the connection is secure.
5. Use four 3x5mm mounting screws (included with Force hardware or with your SATA drive) to secure the SATA drive to
the SATA drive panel. Do not overtighten the screws, but make sure the drive is secure and does not shake.
6. Place the SATA drive panel back onto the bottom panel of your Force hardware, and use the original screws to secure
it in place.
You can now access this drive while using your Force hardware!
