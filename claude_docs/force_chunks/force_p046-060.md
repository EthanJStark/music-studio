16 Levels Drum Note Mode
In 16 Levels Drum Note Mode, the bottom-left quadrant of clip launch
pads can be used like a traditional 4x4 drum pad layout just like Drum
Note Mode. The other three quadrants, however, can be set to control
a selectable parameter that is fixed at values that increase as the pad
numbers increase (e.g., Pad 1 is the minimum, Pad 16 is the maximum),
regardless of how hard you press them.
To enter 16 Level mode, select a drum track and press Note until
16 Level appears on the screen.

16 Level Drum Note Configuration
While in 16 level mode, press and hold Shift and press the Note/Config
button to open the Drum Note Configuration window. In addition to
the standard Drum Note Configuration settings mentioned above, you
can use this to adjust what the 16 level quadrants control.
Use the Top Left, Top Right, and Bottom Right fields to set what
type of 16 Level control is used in each quadrant:
Velocity: The sample velocity increases from lowest (7) to
highest (127).
Tune: The sample tuning increases from the lowest pitch to
highest pitch. By default, the first pad in the quadrant is the
base pitch and the next 12 pads increase by one semitone
each. Use the Transpose field to transpose the original sample
down up to 12 semitones for increased range.
Filter: The cutoff value for the filter increases from lowest to
highest. You can set the filter type for the pad in Track Edit
mode.
Layer: Each row of four pads covers a range of velocity from
lowest to highest: 0-31, 32-64, 65-96 and 97-127. Pads with
multiple samples will play back each layer according to the
Velocity Start and Velocity End settings for each layer.
Attack: The attack envelope of the sample increases from
lowest to highest.
Decay: The decay envelope of the sample increases from
lowest to highest.
Probability: The probability that the note is played increases
from lowest to highest.
Ratchet: The number of note subdivision ratchets increases
from lowest to highest.

Melodic Note Mode

In Melodic Note Mode, the clip launch pads can be used like a
traditional keyboard controller to play melodic notes and chords. For
instance, the image to the right shows the clip launch pads set to play
a scale in Melodic Note Mode. The pads with bright colors are the root
notes of the scale, and the white pads in between are the other degrees
of the scale.
To play a note, press a clip launch pad.
To change the starting octave, hold Shift and press the Track
Assign buttons marked Oct-/Oct+.

Melodic Note Configuration
Press and hold Shift and press the Note/Config button to open the
Melodic Note Configuration window, where you can adjust the
settings of how the notes or chords are laid out on the clip launch pads.

Use the Type selector to determine what will be mapped over the pads:
•
Chromatic: Each pad is assigned a note, ascending by one
semitone with each pad.
•
Scales: Each pad is assigned a note, ascending by one scale
degree with each pad.
•
Harmonize: Each pad is assigned a chord, with the root note ascending by one scale degree with each pad. All
available chords will play in the key determined by the Scale.
•
Chords: Each pad is assigned a chord, with the root note ascending by one scale degree with each pad. You
can play any chord type regardless of the key determined by the Scale. Essentially, this is like the Harmonize
setting but with more options to play chords out of the set key.
•
Progressions: Each pad is assigned a chord in a chord progression. You can play the pads in (or out of) order
to construct songs quickly. The available chords are determined by the Progression field.
•
Tonnetz: Each pad is assigned a note, ascending by a perfect fifth (7 semitones) going left to right along each
row of pads, and ascending by a minor third (3 semitones) going from bottom to top along each column of pads.
•
Guitar: The bottom six rows of pads are organized like a sixstring guitar, with notes ascending E-A-D-G-B-E from bottom
to top in the first column of pads, and ascending by one
semitone with each pad in each row.
•
Bass: The bottom six rows of pads are organized like a sixstring bass, with notes ascending B-E-A-D-G-B from bottom to
top in the first column of pads, and ascending by one semitone
with each in pad in each row.
•
Piano: Every two rows of clip-launch pads are organized like
the traditional white-and-black keys layout of a piano, with the
lower row representing the white keys and the upper row
representing the black keys.
Note: You can also press and hold the Note button while in Note Mode
to quickly select a Type on the display.

Note: For Guitar, Bass and Piano types,
changing the Root Note or Scale will not
affect the layout of notes on the pads, but will
change the highlighted root and scale notes
according to the selection.

Tracks

About Tracks

Each clip you create within a project is routed through a track. There are six types
of tracks, each of which determines how the clip sounds or what it is used for. A
single project can hold up to 128 tracks.
This chapter covers how to create each track type.
To learn about editing your tracks to your preference, see the Modes > Track Edit
Mode chapter.

An Audio track lets you record audio from an external source or by resampling another track to create a clip.
See Audio Tracks for more information.

A drum track uses one or more samples as its sound source. It contains (1) a list of samples and (2) the
settings for each sample (i.e., pad assignments, loop points, pitch tuning, effects, etc.). Drum tracks are used
mostly for creating drum parts and quickly and easily assigning samples to pads. See Drum Tracks for more
information.

A keygroup track uses one or more samples as its sound source. It contains (1) a list of samples and (2) the
settings for each sample (i.e., pitch tuning, effects, etc.). Keygroup tracks are used to play samples
chromatically with a MIDI keyboard or the Force pads. See Keygroup Tracks for more information.

A plugin track contains an instance of a plugin through which you can send your track’s MIDI data. See Plugin
Tracks for more information.

A MIDI track lets you send your track’s MIDI data to an external MIDI device like a synth or drum machine.
See MIDI Tracks for more information.

A CV track lets you send your track’s MIDI data to an external device that uses control voltage (CV), like a
synth. See CV Tracks for more information.

sources will ascend across the new audio tracks you create. When
checked, the first new audio track will use the input source you set above
(e.g., Input 1), the second new audio track will use the next input source
(e.g., Input 2), etc. When unchecked, all of the new audio tracks you create
in this instance will use the same input source. This feature is relevant only
if you are creating more than one new audio track (determined by Number
of Tracks below).
Check the Record Enable box to set the new track to be automatically
record enabled.
Use the Input Monitoring field to set the monitoring behavior: Off, On,
Auto, or Merge.
If you would like to create more than one audio track at once, use the
Number of Tracks field to select how many tracks you would like to create.
4. Tap Do It to confirm, or tap Close, the X or outside the window to go back.
