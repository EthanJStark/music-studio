MIDI Learn

You can use the MIDI Learn function to assign external MIDI controllers to various parameters in your specific Force
project:
• Mixer parameters such as volume, pan, mute, and solo for tracks, returns, submixes, and main outputs.
• Pad parameters (for drum tracks and clip tracks only) such as tuning, filter and amp envelopes, layer settings, LFO
settings, and velocity.
• Track parameters, which depend on the track type.
• Insert effects parameters, which depend on the effect type.
These assignments will be saved with your Force project.

To enter MIDI Learn Mode, press Menu, and then tap MIDI Learn.

Each assignment has the following settings:
Source: This is the name or number of the track, return, submix, or main output.
Target: This is the name of the assigned command or parameter.
Type: This is the type of message:
•
Toggle Button: When the control is a button, pressing it will activate or deactivate its command or parameter.
It will remain in that state until you press it again.
•
Momentary Button: When the control is a button, pressing and holding it down will activate its command or
parameter. Releasing the button will deactivate it.
•
Fixed Button: When the control is a button, pressing it will send its command.
•
Note: When the control is a button, pressing it will send the MIDI note (determined by the Data field).
•
Abs CC: When the control is a knob, turning it will send its CC message (determined by the Data field)
according to the precise physical position of the knob. (When you start turning it, the value may “jump” from
its current value to the one corresponding to the knob’s position.) This is for use with knobs that have a
maximum and minimum position.
•
Rel CC Offset: When the control is a knob, turning it will send the CC message (determined by the Data field),
starting from the current value. This is for use with 360° knobs controlling parameters that have a maximum
and minimum position.
•
Rel CC 2’s Complement: When the control is a knob, turning it will send the CC message (determined by the
Data field), starting from the current value. This is for use with 360° knobs controlling bipolar parameters
where there is a center (12:00) position (e.g., panning).
Type is automatically detected based on the Source and Target fields, though you can use this field to assign it
manually if it does not detect it properly.
Ch: This is the MIDI channel the control is using.
Data: This is the MIDI note number or CC number.
Flip: Tap this box to select or deselect it. When selected, the control’s polarity will be reversed (e.g., a button’s “off”
state will become its “on” state and vice versa).

To assign a parameter to a hardware control:
1. Tap Learn in the upper-right corner so it is on.
2. Tap + on the left side of the touchscreen to create an “empty” assignment (its Target menus will be set to None and
Off).
Alternatively, tap an assignment that is already in the list if you want to change it.
3. Move or press the desired control on your MIDI controller. The Type, Ch, and Data fields will be automatically
assigned.
4. Use the Source field to select a track, return, submix, or main output (for drum tracks and clip tracks, you can select the
entire track or a single pad within it). The Target menu will indicate the source you selected.
5. Use the Target menu to select the parameter. Your selection will be shown under Target in the list, as well.
The control on your MIDI controller will now control the Target parameter.
To assign more controls, repeat Steps 2–5.
To stop assigning controls, tap Learn again so it turns off.

To clear an assignment, tap it in the list, and then tap Clear in the bottom-left corner. Alternatively, follow the steps above
to reassign its Source field to None and assign its Target field to Off.
To clear all assignments, tap Clear All in the upper-right corner.

To delete an assignment (the entire slot), tap it in the list, and then tap Delete in the lower-right corner.

AIR Noise Gate
This effect is similar to a compressor, but instead of
attenuating audio signal that rises above a threshold, a noise
gate attenuates audio signal that falls below a threshold by a
set amount. This can help reduce background noise in your
audio signal.
