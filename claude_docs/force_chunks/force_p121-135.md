Standalone vs. Computer Mode

Force can function in two ways: Standalone Mode and Computer Mode. By default, Force will power on in Standalone
Mode.

In Standalone Mode:
•
The Force hardware will not communicate with a computer over a USB connection.
•
Any files (projects, samples, etc.) that you save or load are in the internal hard drive on your Force or a connected
USB drive or SD card.

In Computer Mode:
•
Force will communicate with a computer over USB connection.
•
Force can be used as an audio interface.
Note: Full Computer Mode support will be available in a forthcoming firmware update.

To enter Computer Mode:
1. Make sure the USB-B Port on Force is connected to your computer.
2. If Force is powered off, press the power button to turn it on.
3. With Force in Standalone Mode, press Menu to open the Menu, and then tap the computer icon in the upper-right
corner.
4. When the Enter Computer Mode window appears, tap Computer Mode to continue. (If you tap Cancel, you can
continue using Force in standalone mode.) Looking for computer may appear briefly on the display before your
computer recognizes the USB connection as a controller.
While in Computer Mode, the display will show Computer Mode with a monitor icon and a button to return to
Standalone Mode.

To return to Standalone Mode:
1. If Force is powered off, press the power button to turn it on.
2. With Force in Computer Mode, press Standalone.
3. A confirmation window will appear. Make sure that you have safely ejected all drives connected to Force, and then
tap Yes to continue. (If you tap Cancel, you can continue using Force in computer mode.)
4. Force will restart into Standalone Mode.
