DrumSynth

The AIR DrumSynth plugins emulate the sound of classic drum
machines and feature multiple synthesis types, advanced
modeling and carefully crafted, built-in effects to create
powerful contemporary drum sounds.
You can add the following drum types as individual plugins per
track: Clap, Crash, HiHat, Kick, Perc, Ride, Snare and Tom.
Each of these instruments has comprehensive synthesis and
effects sections described below.
In each plugin, you can quickly enable or disable the built-in
effects (Transient, Distortion, EQ and Compressor) while
viewing any of the tabs listed below by tapping the buttons on
the right side of the touchscreen under FX.
