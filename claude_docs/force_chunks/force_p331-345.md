Addenda

Updates in Force 3.0.2

New Features

Splice Integration

Your Force now integrates with the Splice platform, allowing you to download and browse your Splice sample library on
your standalone device.

To access Splice:
1. First, make sure your Force hardware is connected to a network via Wi-Fi or Ethernet. See Preferences > Wi-Fi or
Preferences > Ethernet to learn how to connect to a network. You will also need access to a web browser.
2. On your Force, hold Shift and press Menu to open the Preferences page.
3. Navigate to the Splice tab.
4. Tap the Get Login Code button. (If you are not connected to a network, you will be prompted to do so before the Get
Login Code button appears.)
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to pair your Force to your Splice account via a web browser. It may take your Force
a few moments to successfully link.
6. A message will appear on screen when the link has been successfully established. Tap OK to continue and return to
the Splice Preferences page.
7. Once the process is complete and your Force has been paired to your Splice account, use the Sync Files button to
download your samples via Wi-Fi to a drive of your choice.
By default, files will be stored on the Internal drive. You can change the selected drive by tapping the Change button
under Sync Files To Drive.

To browse samples imported from Splice:
1. Open the Browser.
2. Under the Content tab, press the Splice shortcut icon to view samples downloaded from your Splice account.
If nothing appears, make sure that you have connected your Splice account and synced your files by following the
directions above.
3. The right-side of the browser will display your Splice samples organized into a series of top level folders, allowing you
to easily browse your sample library by BPM, Instrument, Key, Pack or Tag. The All Your Samples folder will show a
list of all samples you have downloaded.

Note: The original sample files from Splice are stored in the By Pack folder on your selected drive. Other folders such as
By Instrument contain internal links to help sort these samples by various tags. If the By Pack folder on your drive is
deleted, the files in the remaining folders will become unusable. To fully remove all files, the entire Splice directory should
be deleted.
IMPORTANT: Drives formatted using the FAT32 system do not support these internal links. For these drives, samples will
only be sorted in the By Pack folder. We recommend using an exFAT file system on external drives used with Force, as
it is the most robust one supported by both Windows and macOS.

To view the number of samples available to download from your account, tap the Check For Update button.

To log out of a Splice account, tap the Log Out button.

4. Select a sample, loop, program or project to preview, then tap the Play button to audition. If Auto audition is turned
on, samples will audition when selected.

Step Sequencer Mode – Mono Lanes

Force now includes an additional Step Sequencer mode for melodic track types, Mono Lanes.

Similar to Lanes Mode, in Lanes (Mono) Mode, each column

for the respective drum sample or note. If you press
another clip launch pad in the same column, the previous
note will be removed.
