To select a slice to edit, (after you have created slices in Chop Mode), use the Slice field.

When Link Slices is enabled (after you have created slices in Chop Mode), changing the start point of a slice will also
change the end point of the previous slice. Similarly, changing the end point of a slice will also change the start point of
the next slice. Disable Link Slices if you are trying to create slices that use non-contiguous parts of the sample.
To enable or disable this feature, tap the Link Slices button.
Important: Link Slices must be disabled to make slices non-sequential, noncontiguous, or overlapping.

Use the X-Fade field to apply real-time crossfade looping to sample playback. To apply a crossfade, make sure the Loop
starting point is greater than zero. Then, you can set the Length of the crossfade and the Type, either Equal Power or
Linear.

Use either of the Tune fields to transpose the sample up or down from its original pitch.

Use either of the Root Note fields to set the root note of the sample. This defines which note will play the sample at its
original pitch when in a keygroup track.

Use either of the BPM fields to manually set the BPM of the sample. On the second Trim Mode page, use the X2 and /2
buttons to double of halve the current tempo.

To enter a sample key manually, use the Key fields. One field selects the key root note, and the other field selects
whether the key is Major, Minor or off (--).
To detect the key automatically, tap Detect Key.

To enable or disable 0 Snap, press and hold Shift, and then tap 0 Snap at the bottom of the screen. 0 Snap forces start
points, end points, and loop points to occur only at the waveform’s “zero-crossings.” This can help to avoid clicks and
glitches when playing a sample.

To enable or disable the loop function, press and hold Shift, and then tap Loop at the bottom of the screen. This
switches the loop function between Forward and off. The loop function is described earlier.

Tip: You can use Trim Mode for a specific slice of the sample, previously created and selected in Chop Mode. This allows
for a more detailed view of a single slice than in Chop Mode and gives you more options for auditioning the slice. You can
easily switch between Trim Mode and Chop Mode while doing this.
To use both Trim Mode and Chop Mode to edit a sample slice:
1. Tap Trim/Chop at the bottom of the screen so it says Chop.
2. Set all fields as desired to create your sample slices.
3. Select the desired slice.
4. Tap Trim/Chop at the bottom of the screen so it says Trim. The region you are now editing is indicated by the normal
start point and end point markers rather than slice markers.
5. Tap Trim/Chop at any time to return to Chop Mode.

Tap From BPM to open the Edit Tuning window, which lets you tune a sample to the project.
Use the Beats field to match the number of beats in the sample.
To tune the sample to the project, tap Match. The Tune field will adjust automatically and close the window. The
sample is now tuned to the project.
To tune the sample to the project and adjust the project tempo, tap To Project. This is the same as tapping Match
but it also changes the project's tempo to the BPM shown in the Tempo field on the right.
To close the window, tap Close.

To enter a tempo manually, use the BPM field.
To detect the tempo automatically, tap Detect. In the Edit BPM window that appears, you can do any of the following:
•
Use the BPM field to enter a tempo manually.
•
Tap Detect to detect the tempo automatically.
•
Tap Tap Tempo at the bottom of the screen at the desired rate to use it as the tempo.
•
Tap Close, the X, or anywhere outside the window to close it.

Assigning Samples

You can assign your new sample directly to a pad from Trim Mode.
To assign a sample, tap Assign at the bottom of the screen to open the Assign Sample window.
Important: Assigning a sample to a pad in this way will replace the sample on the first layer of the pad.

If you set the Assign To field to Assign slice to a pad, the pad will
simply refer to the slice in this sample instead of creating a new sample.
This is useful for reducing clutter in your project.

Use the Pad field to select the desired pad. Alternatively, press the
desired pad.

Use the Slice Type field to select how the pad’s layer settings will
be set when the slice is assigned to it (see Track Edit Mode to learn
more about the parameters mentioned below):
•
Non-Destructive Slice: The pad’s Slice setting will be set
to the slice number.
•
Pad Parameters: The pad’s Slice setting will be set to
Pad. The Pad Start and Pad End will be set to the slice’s
start point and end point values, and the Loop Position will
be set to the slice’s start point but with Pad Loop
deactivated.

Use the Track field to specify the track to which you want to add
the slice.

To assign the sample, tap Do It.
To cancel the operation, tap Close, the X, or anywhere outside the
window.

If you set the Assign To field to Make new sample, this will create a
new sample in your project. (The original sample will remain as it is.)

Use the Pad field to select the desired pad. Alternatively, press the
desired pad.

Check the Crop Sample box to delete the unused parts from the
sample when it’s created and assigned. This feature is destructive,
though the project will still contain your original sample.
Leave this box unchecked to keep the unused parts of the sample
when it is created and assigned. This way, you will still be able to edit
the entire sample further even though you are using only part of it at
the moment.

Use the Track field to specify the track to which you want to add
the slice.

To assign the sample, tap Do It.
To cancel the operation, tap Close, the X, or anywhere outside the
window.

Processing Slices & Samples

Tap the Process button to open the Process window, where you can select an editing option for the sample.

Use the Function field to select an editing process. Double-tap it or tap Function at the bottom of the screen to open the
Function window, which displays an overview of all available editing processes.

You can use any of these functions as described below.
To return to Sample Edit Mode, tap Cancel.
To return to the Process window, tap the top of the screen.
Note: All Slice processes will affect only the part of the sample between the start point and the end point. The Sample
processes (Bit Reduce and Stereo -> Mono) will affect the entire sample regardless of its start point or end point.

The Discard process deletes the regions before the start point and after
the end point.

The Delete process deletes the region between the start point and end
point and closes the gap between them.


---

## Page 231

The Silence process replaces the region between the start point and
end point with silence.

The Extract process deletes the regions before the start point and after
the end point and saves it as a new sample in your current project.
Use the Edit Name field (and the virtual keyboard that appears) to
name the new sample.
Tip: This is useful if you recorded a drum loop and wanted to remove
just a snare drum hit, a kick drum hit, etc. to use separately in the
project.

The Normalize process increases a sample’s level to the highest level
possible without distortion. This is essentially a kind of digital gain
optimization, so you do not have to worry about excessive level settings
when working with samples with a wide range of amplitudes.

The Reverse process reverses the region between the start point and
end point.

The Fade In process sets a fade-in between the start point and end
point. The following types are available:
•
Linear fades the audio in with a linear curve—a straight line
between the start and end.
•
Log fades the audio in with a logarithmic curve—quickly rising at
the start and flattening out towards the end.
•
Exp fades the audio in with an exponential curve—slowly rising
in the beginning and growing steeper towards the end.

The Fade Out process sets a fade-out between the start point
and end point. The following types are available:
•
Linear fades the audio out with a linear curve—a straight line
between the start and end.
•
Log fades the audio out with a logarithmic curve—quickly
falling at the start and flattening out towards the end.
•
Exp fades the audio out with an exponential curve—slowly
falling in the beginning and growing steeper towards the end.

The Pitch Shift process changes the pitch of the sample without
changing its length. This lets you set the sample’s pitch to your project
without affecting the sample’s tempo or duration. You can adjust it up
to 12 semitones, up or down. Keep in mind that the audio quality may
decrease at more extreme settings.

The Time Stretch process lengthens or shortens the sample without
changing its pitch. This is useful for matching the durations of two
samples with different pitches. You can enter the original tempo of the
sample and the desired tempo after processing.
Use the Beat field to set the desired value number of beats.
Use the New Tempo field to set the new tempo. The Ratio field will
then automatically show the time stretch factor.
Alternatively, to adjust the ratio instead, use the Ratio field to set
the desired ratio. The New Tempo field will then change
automatically based on the new time stretch factor.

The Gain Change process raises or lowers the volume of the sample.
You can adjust it up to 18 dB, higher or lower. This function is different
than Normalize because it will allow volumes beyond clipping level. This
may be a desired effect, but remember to watch your output level!

The Copy process saves a copy of the sample.
Use the Edit Name field (and the virtual keyboard that appears) to
name the new sample. Otherwise, the process will add a consecutive
number after the sample name.

The Bit Reduce process lowers the bit resolution of a sample,
effectively reducing its degree of faithful reproduction. You can reduce
it down to 1 bit. (The sound is similar to the Resampler effect, but Bit
Reduce will permanently alter the sample.)
Tip: Use this on drum loops to get a dirty, “old-school” sizzle but with
a digital “edge.”
Note: This process affects the entire sample regardless of its start
point or end point.

The Stereo -> Mono process converts a stereo sample to a new mono
sample and saves it as a new sample.
Use the Edit Name field (and the virtual keyboard that appears) to
name the new sample. Otherwise, the process will add a consecutive
number after the sample name.
The following options are available:
•
Left will convert the left channel only.
•
Right will convert the right channel only.
•
Sum will combine the left and right audio channels to a
single mono channel.
Note: This process affects the entire sample regardless of its start
point or end point.

Chop Mode

Whereas Trim Mode crops only the start and/or end off of a sample, Chop Mode divides the sample into multiple regions
called slices. We recommend using Chop Mode when working with a long sample with different sounds throughout (e.g.,
a drum loop or a long melodic or harmonic passage).

To enter Chop Mode, tap the Trim/Chop button in the lower-left corner so it says Chop.

Use the Start and End fields to set the position of the start point and end point (respectively) of the currently selected slice.
Alternatively, tap and drag the start (S) or end (E) marker left or right, or use Knobs 1 and 2 to adjust the start point or
Knobs 3 and 4 to adjust the end point when the knobs are in screen mode.

Use the selector in the lower-left corner of the screen to choose how you want to use Chop Mode:

Manual
This method lets you insert slices at locations you select.

Threshold
This method uses an adjustable detection algorithm that derives the number of slices created from the volume
levels present in the sample.
Use the Threshold field to set the threshold level. The higher the selected value, the more slices will be created.
Use the Min Time field to set the minimum length of a slice in milliseconds.

Regions
This method divides a sample into several slices of equal length.
Use the Regions field to set how many regions the sample will be divided into. The higher the selected value, the
more slices will be created.

BPM
This method divides a sample into several slices based on the tempo (beats per minute).
Use the Bars field to set how many bars are in the sample.
Use the Beats field to set how many beats are in each bar.
Use the Time Div field to set a note division. The slice markers will be placed according to this setting. You can
select 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, or 1/32. (In most cases, you should set this parameter to 1/16.)

To play a slice, when the headphones icon (in the upper-right corner) is selected, tap a slice in the waveform.

When the One Shot feature is enabled, you can press a pad once to play the entire slice. When this is disabled, pressing
the pad and holding it will play the slice; releasing it will stop playback.
To enable or disable One Shot, press and hold Shift, and then tap One Shot.

To select a slice to edit, do any of the following:
•
Use the Slice field.
•
When the knobs are in screen mode, turn Knob 6.
•
When the headphones icon (in the upper-right corner) is selected, tap a slice in the waveform.

To add a slice at the current playhead position, tap Slice+ at the bottom of the screen. You can do this at any point
during sample playback.

To split or combine slices, tap the glue-and-scissors icon. In the Split/Combine Region screen that appears, tap one
of the following buttons:
•
Split: This splits the currently selected region into two equal slices.
•
Combine: This combines the currently selected region with the one before it.
•
Back: This closes the window.

When Link Slices is enabled, changing the start point of a slice will also change the end point of the previous slice.
Similarly, changing the end point of a slice will also change the start point of the next slice. Disable Link Slices if you are
trying to create slices that use non-contiguous parts of the sample.
To enable or disable this feature, tap the Link Slices button.
Important: Link Slices must be disabled to make slices non-sequential, noncontiguous, or overlapping.

To remove all slices from a sample, press and hold Shift and tap Clear All.

The cue playhead is useful when manually inserting slice markers. You can set its position and behavior to suit your
workflow.
To adjust the position of the Cue playhead, do any of the following:
•
Use the Cue field.
•
Tap and drag the translucent marker with the triangle ().
•
When the knobs are in screen mode, turn knob 5.
To play the sample from the cue playhead, tap Play Cue at the bottom of the screen.
To create a slice marker at the cue playhead position, tap Slice+ at the bottom of the screen.
To set how the cue playhead behaves, use the Settings window (described earlier).

0 Snap forces start points and end points to occur only at the waveform’s “zero-crossings.” This can help to avoid clicks
and glitches when playing a sample.
To enable or disable 0 Snap, press and hold Shift, and then tap 0 Snap at the bottom of the screen.

Converting or Assigning Slices

You can assign your new sample directly to a pad from Chop Mode. You can also convert it into a new track or patched
phrase.
To convert or assign a sample, press and hold Shift, and then tap Convert at the bottom of the screen to open the
Convert or Assign Slices window.

If you set the Convert To field to New drum track using slices, this will
create a new track and assign the sample’s slices to its pads. The pads
will simply refer to the slices in this sample instead of creating new
samples. This is useful for reducing clutter in your project. The new track
will be named after the sample and appended with ch.

Use the Slice Type field to select how each pad’s layer settings will
be set when the slices are assigned to them (see Track Edit Mode to
learn more about the parameters mentioned below):
•
Non-Destructive Slice: Each pad’s Slice setting will be set to
the slice number.
•
Pad Parameters: Each pad’s Slice setting will be set to Pad.
The Pad Start and Pad End parameters will be set to the slice’s
start point and end point values, and the Loop Pos parameter
will be set to the slice’s start point but with Pad Loop
deactivated.

Check the Create Events box to automatically create a new clip in
which each pad plays its corresponding slice in ascending
sequence by pad number.

If Create Events is checked, use the Bars field to set how many
bars the slices’ events will occupy.

To convert the sample, tap Do It.
To cancel the operation, tap Close.


---

## Page 238

238

If you set the Convert To field to New track with new samples, this
will create a new sample from each slice and assign them to pads in a
new track.
The new track will be named after the sample and appended with ch.
The new samples will be appended with SI-# (where # is a consecutive
number).

Check the Crop Samples box to delete the unused parts from the
sample when they are created and assigned. This feature is
destructive, though the project will still contain your original sample.
Leave this box unchecked to keep the unused parts of the samples
when they’re created and assigned. This way, you will still be able
to edit the entire samples further even though you are using only
part of them at the moment.

By default, this option already will create a new track. You can
uncheck the Create new track box to convert each slice into a
sample that is placed in the project’s sample pool but not assigned
to a track or pad.

If Create new track is checked, check the Create Events box to
automatically create a new clip in the new track in which each pad
plays its corresponding slice in ascending sequence by pad number.

If Create Events is checked, use the Bars field to set how many
bars the slices’ events will occupy.

To convert the sample, tap Do It.
To cancel the operation, tap Close.

If you set the Convert To field to Assign slice to a pad, the pad will
simply refer to the slice in this sample instead of creating a new sample.
This is useful for reducing clutter in your project.
Important: Assigning a sample to a pad in this way will replace the
sample on the first layer of the pad.

Use the Pad field to select the desired pad. Alternatively, press the
desired pad.

Use the Slice Type field to select how the pad’s layer settings will
be set when the slice is assigned to it (see Track Edit Mode to learn
more about the parameters mentioned below):
•
Non-Destructive Slice: The pad’s Slice setting will be set to
the slice number.
•
Pad Parameters: The pad’s Slice setting will be set to Pad.
The Pad Start and Pad End will be set to the slice’s start point
and end point values, and the Loop Position will be set to the
slice’s start point but with Pad Loop deactivated.

Use the Track field to specify the track to which you want to add
the slice.

To convert the sample, tap Do It.
To cancel the operation, tap Close.

If you set the Convert To field to Patched phrase, this will create a
new sample that will play based on the tempo of your project, and
places it in the current project. The patched phrase will have the same
name as the original sample but appended with pp and will use a
different icon when viewing your project information.

Use the Bars field to set how many bars long the patched phrase
is meant to be.

Processing Slices

Press and hold Shift, and then tap the Process button to open the Process window, where you can select an editing
option for the currently selected slice. (This has fewer options than Trim Mode. Unavailable ones are darkened.)
Use the Function field to select an editing process. Double-tap it or tap Function at the bottom of the screen to open the
Function window, which displays an overview of all available editing processes.
Important: Chop Mode is non-destructive: You can choose the slice/edit behavior without destroying your original sample,
giving you more control over sample playback; you can save your sliced sample and but also reuse all of the slice data in
another project. See the Track Edit Mode chapter to learn more about setting a pad to play the entire sample, a specific slice
of a sample, or a specific region of the sample (independent of its slice markers).

You can use any of these functions as described below.
To return to Sample Edit Mode, tap Cancel.
To return to the Process window, tap the top of the screen.
Note: All processes here will affect only the currently selected slice.
