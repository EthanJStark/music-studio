Drum and Keygroup Track Improvements

Drum and Keygroup tracks have been significantly reworked to add more features and improve the ergonomics of the
editors. The Track Edit interface has been improved overall, and many new features have been added.

Sample Tail
Drum and Keygroup Tracks now include a Tail Length and Tail Start
parameters for adding extra audio tail to any chopped sample. This is
useful for things like making an abrupt end to a sample sound more
natural or adding experimental looping effects to a sample.
To adjust the tail of a sample:
1. Load a Drum or Keygroup Track.
2. Press Menu, and then tap Track Edit to open Track Edit mode.
3. Tap the Samples tab to open the first page.
4. Use the Tail Length parameter to enable the sample tail and
set its length.
5. Use the Tail Start parameter to set the starting point of the tail
for looping. Set this to smaller values for delay effects, or longer
values for more obvious looping effects.

Drum FX
You can now quickly add effects to samples in a Drum track by using the built-in Drum FX
To use the Drum FX:
1. Load a Drum Track.
2. Press Menu, and then tap Track Edit to open Track Edit Mode.
3. Tap the Effects tab twice to open the second page.
4. There are eight available Drum FX slots, each with an adjustable
parameter:
•

keygroup tracks by randomizing parameters.
To adjust the Randomization parameters:
1. Load a Drum or Keygroup tracks.
2. Press Menu, and then tap Program Edit to open Program Edit
mode.
3. Tap the Samples tab until you reach the fourth page.
4. Use the knobs to adjust the available randomization
parameters for each layer: Pitch, Level, Pan, Sample Offset,
and Envelope (Attack, Decay, Cutoff, Resonance).
Use the Depth slider to control the amount of randomization
applied overall.

Other Enhancements
Drum and Keygroup tracks now have adjustable curve parameters for each time stage.
Drum and Keygroup tracks now have an adjustable Pitch envelope.
Drum and Keygroup tracks now have Note-Off as an available option for the Sample Play triggering parameter.
Keygroup tracks now have Portamento, Time, Quantize, and Legato parameters that can be controlled through track
automation.

Standalone Audio Interface Support

You can now use most audio interfaces that are both USB class-compliant and Linux class-compliant with your
standalone Force. Audio devices must also be set to 44.1 kHz sample rate and 128 sample buffer size.
Note: If you are unsure of your audio interface’s compatibility, check with the original equipment manufacturer for more
information.

To use an external audio interface:
1. Open the Menu and tap Preferences to open the Preferences.
2. Select the Audio Device settings from the sidebar.
3. Use the Audio Device field to select the Internal sound device or a connected, class-compliant audio interface.
Check the 32 Inputs/Outputs box to enable use of up to 32 simultaneous inputs and outputs.
Note: Increasing the number of simultaneous inputs and outputs will also increase CPU overhead.

Bus Automation

You can now automate parameters on all buses (submixes, returns, main output tracks). The recording, playback and
editing of this automation follows the same workflow as all other automation.
You can create, record, or play clips containing automation data on bus tracks. In Clip Matrix Mode, press the Master
button to view the Returns and Output tracks, and then create a clip as normal. Double-tap on a bus track header to
open the Track Settings window, where you can rename the bus track, change the color of the track header, and set the
row launch behavior. You can then use the bus tracks like normal tracks to view, edit and input automation using the
Editors.
You can also record automation from these clips into Arrange mode and view, edit, and input automation data in your
arrangement.
FX Racks and FX Rack knob assignments will also now work on buses.

MIDI track with renamed parameters and use it in any Force project.

To rename a MIDI control:
1. Select a MIDI track.
2. Press Menu, and then tap Track Edit to open Track Edit Mode.
3. Tap the Edit button at the top of the screen.
4. Tap the MIDI Control dropdown menu to select the MIDI
assignment for each control.
5. Tap the pencil icon to edit the name of the selected control using
the keyboard that appears.

You can now set CV tracks to Melodic or Drum operation. Melodic CV
tracks behave the same as previous Force versions. Drum CV tracks
can be used to configure any pad to output on any CV port.

To set the CV track type:
1. Load a CV track.
2. Double-tap the track header to open the Track Settings window.
3. Under CV Settings, use the Type field to select Melodic or Drum.

To edit the assignments of a Drum type CV track:
1. After setting the track type to Drum in the Track Settings window,

MIDI Learn

You can use the MIDI Learn function to assign external MIDI controllers to various parameters in your specific Force
project:
• Mixer parameters such as volume, pan, mute, and solo for tracks, returns, submixes, and main outputs.
• Pad parameters (for drum tracks and clip tracks only) such as tuning, filter and amp envelopes, layer settings, LFO
settings, and velocity.
• Track parameters, which depend on the track type.
• Insert effects parameters, which depend on the effect type.
These assignments will be saved with your Force project.

To open MIDI Learn Mode, press Menu, and then tap MIDI Learn.

Each assignment has the following settings:
Source: This is the name or number of the track, return, submix, or
main output.
Target: This is the name of the assigned command or parameter.
Type: This is the type of message:
•
Toggle Button: When the control is a button, pressing it will
activate or deactivate its command or parameter. It will
remain in that state until you press it again.
•
Momentary Button: When the control is a button, pressing
and holding it down will activate its command or parameter.
Releasing the button will deactivate it.
•
Fixed Button: When the control is a button, pressing it will send its command.
•
Note: When the control is a button, pressing it will send the MIDI note (determined by the Data field).
•
Abs CC: When the control is a knob, turning it will send its CC message (determined by the Data field)
according to the precise physical position of the knob. (When you start turning it, the value may “jump” from
its current value to the one corresponding to the knob’s position.) This is for use with knobs that have a
maximum and minimum position.
•
Rel CC Offset: When the control is a knob, turning it will send the CC message (determined by the Data field),
starting from the current value. This is for use with 360° knobs controlling parameters that have a maximum
and minimum position.
•
Rel CC 2’s Complement: When the control is a knob, turning it will send the CC message (determined by the
Data field), starting from the current value. This is for use with 360° knobs controlling bipolar parameters
where there is a center (12:00) position (e.g., panning).
Type is automatically detected based on the Source and Target fields, though you can use this field to assign it
manually if it does not detect it properly.
Ch: This is the MIDI channel the control is using.
Data: This is the MIDI note number or CC number.
Flip: Tap this box to select or deselect it. When selected, the control’s polarity will be reversed (e.g., a button’s “off”
state will become its “on” state and vice versa).

controls, along with a dedicated feedback path. A built-in creative effects chain allows you to apply EQ, Chorus, and Delay
to further sculpt your sound. Over 400 presets are included, ranging from basses, leads, percussion, and synth FX.

The Fabric Series includes four new plugin instruments: Fabric XL, Fabric, Fabric Piano, and Fabric Electric Piano.
Fabric XL is the brand-new flagship sample-based synthesizer from AIR Music Technology and delivers the ultimate
sounds for all your production needs. Fabric XL brings a stunning collection of cutting-edge presets, including
everything from twisted and dark motion pads, drone and sub-basses, acoustic and electric guitars, acoustic and
electric pianos, classic poly and lead synths, and much more.
Fabric is almost identical to Fabric XL, but removes the largest sample keymaps to reserve less of your Force’s memory.
Fabric Piano and Fabric Electric Piano deliver the sonic characteristics of the flagship Stage Piano and Stage EP
instruments, respectively, but in less CPU-intensive forms. Each includes a comprehensive set of editing features and
built-in effects, such as the AIR Flavor effect for adding grit for a lo-fi sound.
