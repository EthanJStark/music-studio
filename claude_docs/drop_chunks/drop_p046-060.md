Min / Max
Set the minimum and maximum output voltage range of the outgoing signals. Clock
signals are rising edge per default. You can turn then into falling edge by inverting Min and Max voltage.
Hold Shift while changing the parameter increases the step size, so the parameter changes faster.
CV IN 1+2
The CV inputs can either be used for clock signals or to trigger snapshots by external CV and gate signals.
CV IN1
4PPQN (16th notes)
2PPQN (8th notes)
The incoming clock signal may have two different speeds.
CV IN2
Without function
With this setting, CV IN2 is ignored. When Drop is synced to
CV1 s clock input, playback will start with the first rising edge
’
at CV IN1 and stop playback when the clock signal stops after
a short timeout.
Start Trigger
Starts the clock when a trigger occurs at CV IN2.
Start/Stop Gate
Playback keeps running while the signal at CV IN2 is high and
stops as soon as the signal goes low.
CV IN1+2
Jump Snapshot Trig
Jump Snapshot Select
This option is to connect the CV and gate output of a sequencer
to Drop s CV IN1 and IN2 to select and fire snapshots in Jump
’

mode. The voltage at CV IN2 selects the snapshot, with the
voltage range from 0 to 5V is mapped to the 20 snapshots of the
current bank. When there is a rising edge at CV IN1, the
snapshot will be fired in Jump mode and the potentiometer
determines the fade time.
46
Specify the type of clock signal in
the CV settings and it will be taken
over in the clock settings.

Remote
Drop can also be remotely controlled via MIDI. You can link two or more Drops to jam with your band members and keep the same timing, or
expand the amount of available controls and connections, or use another MIDI device to control Drop s functions and embed it into a bigger setup.
’
Jump by MIDI notes
Fire snapshots from an external MIDI source like a sequencer or a keyboard. Only the 4x5 snapshots of the current bank are affected. Snapshots are
fired in Jump mode,  the fade potentiometer determines the fade time, and PLAY > Quantization is used for timing.
Mode
Off
Ignore notes.
By Pitch
The note number pitch  determines chooses the snapshot. The Base Note and the
(
)
19 notes above are taken into account and are mapped to one snapshot each.
Notes exceeding that range are cropped and treated like the base note or the
highest note which is base note + 20. The base note corresponds to the lower left
snapshot and the highest note to the upper right snapshot. If the incoming note
does not exactly match a snapshot, the closest snapshot is selected.
Use this mode to connect a programmable MIDI sequencer.
Velo 1-20
Only the base note is taken into account, other notes do not fire a snapshot. Choose
the snapshot according to velocity values 1-20. If the incoming note has a velocity
larger than 20, it is cropped and treated as velocity = 20. Also here, velocity = 0
corresponds to the lower left and velocity >= 20 to the upper right snapshot.
Use this mode to connect a programmable MIDI sequencer.
Velo 1-127
Only the base note is taken into account, other notes do not fire a snapshot. The
snapshot is selected using the velocity value, where the full velocity range 1-127 is
spread evenly across snapshots.
Use this mode to connect a MIDI trigger pad played by hand.

Receive and Send
Many of Drop s functions can be remotely accessed via MIDI CC messages. There are different levels of depth
’

tailored to real-world use cases that enable remote control.
You can use these settings to link two or more Drop units to play along.
On both Drops, you need to add a Device for the other connected Drop and select a MIDI out and a MIDI
input port. In MENU > Settings, you can enable Receive and Send independently and thereby have a master
Drop. If both Drops should be able to set the remote parameters, you need to enable both Send and Receive
on both Drops. also make sure, that for each data direction, the MIDI channel is identical.
You still need to setup MIDI clock separately.
Jam Mode
The intended use case for this mode is playing a live set with a partner. Both have their own independent
setup with their own Drop as the master controller. Jam mode ensures that the Drop moment and the cycle
playback position are in sync across both setups. Besides that, each of you can play their own setup
independently.
Dual Mode
Choose this mode to use a second Drop unit as an extension for more control elements and hardware ports.
By using this mode, the user interface and connectivity doubles in size. When selecting a Bank on the sender
Drop, the receiver Drop will also switch the bank. Also, all snapshot related settings like quantization,
exclusiveness, or the fade time potentiometer are overwritten on the receiver Drop by the sender Drop.
Full Mode
This mode goes one step further than Dual mode, so when scheduling or firing a Snapshot on the sender, it also
schedules and fires the same snapshot on the receiver Drop.

Settings
Options
Brightness
The overall LED and display brightness. Stored globally, not per project.
Default Color
When activating a new control element, this is the default LED color.
Keyboard layout
Tells if a connected USB keyboard has QWERTY or QWERTZ layout. Stored globally.
Moving shows
When moving a control element, the display can also show the name and/or the value of the control element. When playing
in bright sunlight, the display s readability is usually better than the LEDs.
’
Note: You can give each control element its own name, so when coming back to a project after some time it is easier to
remember everything. To speed up naming and menu navigation, you can connect a USB keyboard to Drop.
Latest Snapshot
When executing a snapshot in Jump mode, Drop mode, or by editing it, its button keeps blinking softly. This helps to
remember the last action during a performance and to keep track of everything.
MENU but returns
to root
In some menus, the MENU button is also used as a back button. When this option is activated, the MENU button takes you
back all the way to the root of the menu, otherwise it may only take you back one step. Deactivate this option if you feel
familiar with Drop.
Multiple Drops
When activated, multiple snapshots can be combined to be scheduled simultaneously as a Drop. If two snapshots share the
same control elements, the snapshot you press last has priority.
When deactivated, only one snapshot can be exclusively scheduled as a Drop.
Multiple Jumps
When activated, multiple snapshots can be combined in a Jump. If two snapshots share the same control elements, the
snapshot you press last has priority. Adding a snapshot to an ongoing Jump will re-start the fade time. When a Jump is
already fading, you can also deselect snapshots from the fade one by one.
When deactivated, only one snapshot can be exclusively be used for a Jump at a time.

## Page 58

Jump time
The maximum Jump time when the fade time potentiometer is turned fully to the right. In the leftmost position, the fade time
is always 0, resulting in an instant Jump.
1 cycle max: One full cycle, no matter how many bars or which tempo is currently set.
10...60 seconds: Fixed time, independent from tempo and number of bars per cycle.
Send all after load
When loading a project, all control element s current MIDI values and Remote TX messages are sent as one-shots.
’
Note: Press Shift + Play to force-send all MIDI and Remote TX messages any time.
Chain to Bank
In chain mode, selecting a different chain 1-20 also changes the snapshot bank 1-20.
Bank to Chain
When selecting a different snapshot bank 1-20, the snapshot chain with the same number 1-20 is automatically selected.
Note: Switching to a different chain will always stop playback of the currently active chain.
Note: Bank
 Chain linkage is especially useful, when you arrange your set to perform up to 20 songs, using one chain and
↔
one snapshot bank per song.
USB1/2 port mode
Host + Device: When connected to another USB device, Drop auto detects if its USB port 1 or 2 should take host or device
role. In Host mode, Drop also applies 5V power to the connected device.
Device Only: Drop s USB port 1 or 2 is forced to stay in device role and does not supply power to the connected device.
’
Test mode
Push the Test  button to enter a test mode in which you can verify that Drop s hardware works correctly. Turn the encoder to switch pages. Test
“
”
’
mode allows you to see if all LEDs work as expected, lets you test all push buttons, encoders and faders and lets you test CV and TRS inputs and
outputs.
Note: In test mode, CV and MIDI will not work. Test signals (0-5V ramp) and test messages are sent over all CV and TRS outputs which are not valid
MIDI data.

Project
Management
In MENU > Project you can save, recall, create, rename and delete projects. Also, there are options to
initialize a new project for either DAW-only use or hardware device use, as well as a purge function to help
you clean up a cluttered project.
Projects are stored on Drop s Micro SD card in the /Projects folder. The file format is .json JavaScript object
’
(

notation  which means that it is a human-readable format that is open for future editing in a web
)

environment.
You can also navigate subfolders inside the /Projects directory if you need to, but you need to create them
on the SD card using your computer.
Save Project
Store the current project. Push the NEW+ button to create a new project or select an existing project name. Leave
the name as it is to overwrite the existing file or change the name to save a second version of the project.
Load Project
Select and load a project from the file system. Use the NEW+ button to start off with an empty project same as

Purge Project
Helps you clean up a cluttered project. There are several tasks available that can be turned on or off separately
before proceeding. The purge function does not change the functionality of your project, it simply cleans up
unused parts and re-sorts slots.
Reset unused devices
The parameters of devices that are not turned ON in MENU > Devices, will be reset to their initial
states. So if you turned on a device, changed some parameters, then turned it off again, the
changed parameters still persist in case you want to re-enable the device later. This function resets
the parameters of all devices that are not enabled.
Re-sort device order
If there are gaps between active devices, active devices with higher slot numbers will be moved to
lower slots, so that gaps are closed. E.g. if only devices 1, 3, 4, 7 are activated, they will be moved to
slots 1, 2, 3, 4.
Remove inactive controls
Checks for each control element if it is active but does not have any MIDI mapping or any internal
link CV out or Merger assignment . If the control element is not actively used, it will be turned off
(
)
and reset to its initial state.
Also snapshots are checked. If a snapshot is active but does not contain any data and does not have
MIDI assigned, it will be turned off and reset to its initial state.
Reset unused slots
Goes over all MIDI slots of all control elements and snapshots. If a slot is not used or has a mapping
where the corresponding device is not active, the slot will be reset to its initial state.
Re-sort slots
Goes over all MIDI slots of all control elements and snapshots. If there are gaps between active slots,
slots with higher numbers will be moved to lower slots, so that gaps are closed.
