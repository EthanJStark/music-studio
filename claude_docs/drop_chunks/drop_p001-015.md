Power
Power Drop using the included power supply or via the USB1 port. The benefit of using the included 12V power supply is that you still have both
USB-C ports available to connect other gear. It is also the best choice to suppress audible noise caused by ground loops.
Power input: 12V DC, 1200 mA min
what Drop requires when powered via external power supply
USB1 input:
5V DC,   1500 mA min
what Drop requires when powered via USB1
USB1 output: 5V DC,   1500 mA max
when Drop is used as USB host to power other gear via USB (automatic host role detection)
USB2 output: 5V DC,   500 mA max         when Drop is used as USB host to power other gear via USB (automatic host role detection)
If you are using USB-C, you must use the USB1 port with the little flash symbol next to it. You also need a USB-C-to-C connection and your USB host
must be able to supply at least 1500mA. Computer USB-C ports usually can supply twice as much current.
Only USB-C to USB-C cables in conjunction with a USB-C host or power supply can be used to power Drop. USB-A cables and USB-A power
supplies will NOT work for power, even if the power supply meets the electrical requirements. The USB-A socket does not allow the necessary
power negotiation between Drop and power supply.

Connectivity
Drop can control up to eight other MIDI devices with
its user interface. Drop features 2x USB and 4x TRS
MIDI ports, so that each device benefits from its own
connection, providing full data bandwidth and its own
clock signal with individual micro-delay.
In this example...
The laptop (DAW  only offers USB connections, so it is
)

obvious to connect it via USB. The laptop may also
power Drop via its USB1 port.
The SEQUENCER may send a lot of MIDI data, so it
may be a good choice to connect it via USB. Also,
Drop can eventually power the sequencer via USB.
Incoming MIDI, e.g. from KEYBOARD, GROOVEBOX,
DAW, SEQUENCER, SYNTH A, can be distributed to
other devices using Drop s
’ Device Merger function.
Drop s MIDI
’
In and Out ports are not related to each
other and can be used for different devices, like
KEYBOARD and SYNTH D in this example.
It is still possible to connect devices in classic daisychain cabling, using MIDI Thru, like SYNTH A and B.
Drop s two
’
CV inputs and outputs are mostly used for
clock and timing. The outputs can also be variable 05V control voltages 12-bit DAC .

USB, TRS, CV pros and cons
USB-MIDI:
High data rate, not so precise with MIDI clock timing. Requires class-compliant MIDI gear if Drop is used as USB host.
TRS-MIDI:
Low data rate, but mostly sufficient, especially when each device has its own cable carrying only the device s data. Precise clock timing.
’
CV:
On Drop, same clock timing precision as TRS-MIDI.
2x USB-C
USB MIDI
Connect laptops or class-compliant MIDI devices to Drop. With USB, there is always host and device role to be negotiated. Drop will automatically
detect which mode is necessary and can also act as a MIDI host for other controllers and instruments. In MENU > Settings, you can switch the mode
for each port from Host + Device  auto-detection to Device Only . As a MIDI host, Drop can supply 5V on each port to power the connected
“
”
“
”
device. USB1 can supply up to 1500mA and USB2 up to 500mA. The specs are also printed on Drop s bottom side. You can also use the included
’
USB-C to USB-A adaptor if your device requires an oldschool USB-A/B cable.
USB-hubs are not supported, so you can only connect one USB device per port.
To connect to MIDI devices via USB, your device must be class-compliant. This means, that no driver needs to be installed to use it, which applies to
most gear out on the market. However, some manufacturers e.g. Roland  still require a driver for their USB-MIDI gear. To use their devices with
(
)
Drop, you need to use the classic MIDI TRS/DIN connection. Drop will show you a popup message if the USB gear connected is not class-compliant.
USB keyboard
Connect a USB computer keyboard for navigation and to name devices, controls and
snapshots.
In Menu > Settings, select the approriate layout e.g.
(
QWERTY, QWERTZ, AZERTY .)
Navigation = Arrow keys, Escape, Enter, Backspace.
Change slot = Shift + Arrow keys
CTRL+9 = MENU button
CTRL+0 = PLAY button
CTRL+1-8 = Buttons around the display, clockwise

4x MIDI TRS In, 4x MIDI TRS Out
Use these ports to connect any MIDI equipment to Drop. Four ports enable you to connect one device per port in a star-topology instead of daisy
chaining the MIDI signal from device to device. The star-topology enables high data throughput and individual MIDI clock delays per device.
Use the small switches on the back to select TRS type A or B for Drop s MIDI output. If you pick the wrong mode, your device may not receive
’
MIDI data from Drop.
2x CV out
Drop s CV inputs and outputs support a voltage range between 0,0 and 5,0 Volts.
’
The outputs can be used independently to send different kinds of clock signals, triggers and gates to sync analogue gear. They can also be used as a
simple continuous voltage outputs that can be assigned to any of Drop s controls. The resolution is 12 bits 4096 steps .
’
(
)
2x CV in
Use CV inputs 1 and 2 to connect Drop to an external analogue clock source. CV1 expects the clock signal 16
(
th or 8th notes  and CV2 can be
)
configured to receive a dedicated start and stop trigger or gate signal.
There is also another mode available that lets you use the CV1 and 2 inputs to fire snapshots from external modular gear, where CV In 1 receives
triggers and CV In 2 receives a control voltage to select a snapshot. You can enable this mode in the CV Config menu.
If you are planning to control your modular rack with Drop, we recommend to use a dedicated MIDI-to-CV-out converter module.

Step-by-step workflow
1  Decide which gear to use
)
Before getting into Drop, you should have an idea of what kind of setup you want to build and what gear you want to connect to Drop. Ideally, you
already have your grooveboxes or synths play a loop, and now it is time to create an accessible user interface for them on Drop.
2  Init your project
)
Select Project > Clean Init. You now have an empty project that does absolutely nothing  the perfect starting point for a
–
setup with hardware gear,
where mapping is all done in Drop.
For a DAW-only setup, Project > DAW Init is a one-click init option that applies a default mapping to Drop, so that every control element sends out a
default CC message over USB1. From there, you can map everything in your DAW. You can skip steps 3 and 4.
3  Create and configure devices
)
Go to the Devices menu and add the devices you want to use in your live set up to 8 devices max . Even if your device uses multiple MIDI channels,
(
)
you only need to list it as one device in Drop. Also hook up keyboards and sequencers that merge their data with Drop s data and send it out to
’
other connected gear. You should also configure clocks in this step.
4  Mapping on Drop
)
Each of Drop s controls can send out up to 8 different MIDI messages with different curves which allows flexible macro mapping. Each control offers
’
8 Slots to set up different kind of MIDI messages. This is an essential and powerful feature to create a user interface that speaks across multiple
devices in your setup.
Use the Mapping menu to configure the controls you want to use. Depending on your target device, you can either enter the MIDI parameters by
hand, use MIDI Learn, or use the included MIDI CC and NRPN database if it contains your target device.
5  Snapshots
)
By now, you should have developed a feeling for your newly created user interface. It is time to create some snapshots! These can either be fallback
safety net points, peak moments, snapshots that only affect a subset of controls so you can combine them later, a fixed chain of snapshots that
follow your song s arrangement, or you simply skip snapshots and use them spontaneously on stage as save-and-recall points.

PLAY view
Beatjump
This view controls and shows the playback position
inside the current cycle. Use the eight buttons around
the display to jump to another playback position while
playing.
Note: Performing a beatjump also sends a Song Position message to all devices, that have the according
check mark set in the clock menu.

Cycle length
The cycle length can be set from 1 to 32 bars.
Drop is not a sequencer itself, but you can connect other sequencers or
grooveboxes with their internal sequencers to Drop. These other devices
can run their own sequencers with their own time signature. Drop on the
other hand simply keeps a global time measure.
Internally, Drop uses 16 sixteenth notes per bar. But this only plays a role
for clock signals.

Monitor
The MIDI monitor helps to see and debug what is going on between Drop and a connected MIDI device.
•
Verify, that Drop sends out the data your device expects.
•
Verify, that the connected device sends data back.
•
Check if a device sends unnecessary data that can be filtered out in the MIDI merge filter.

MENU view
Devices
Setting up devices is the first step you should do when creating a new live set. In this menu, up to 8 MIDI
devices can be configured that Drop can interact with at the same time.
Decide, to which port you want to connect your device and if it needs MIDI output, input, or both.
You can verify proper communication using the MIDI Monitor in the PLAY view.

ON

Activate or deactivate the device and the control elements linked to it.
Name
Enter the name of your device, for convenience during the mapping process.
Default Channel
The default MIDI channel number. Each control that maps to this device can either send to the
default channel or a specific channel 1-16. If your device only uses one channel, use the default channel in the
mapping. That way, if you want to switch the channel at a later point, you only have to change it in the device
menu instead of changing it in each control.
If you connect a device that uses multiple channels, you should still set up only one device for it.
You can select each control element s channel in that element s mapping specifically. The channel you
’
’
set in the device is just a default value.
