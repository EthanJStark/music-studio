Press the **Launch** button to make sure the **clip launch pads** are in **Launch Mode** . In this pad mode, each pad represents
a single clip in a track. The lighted pads represent the clips shown on the display, and the dim pads are empty clips.


Tap the first clip in **Track 8 – Drum Kit** to begin playing it. The **clip launch pad** will slowly blink green to indicate it is
active, and the clip on the display will show the position of the playhead in the clip.


Now, while in Launch mode, press the **clip launch pad** below the pad that is currently playing. The second clip will start
playing after the next bar.


See _**Operation**_ _>_ _**General Features**_ _>_ _**Pad Modes**_ _>_ _**Launch Mode**_ to learn more.


Clips will continue to play until another clip in the same track is launched, until playback is stopped or until the clip is
stopped while playback continues.


**To stop playback,** press the **Stop** button.


**To stop the clip,** first press the **Clip Stop** button to assign the **Track Assign** buttons to stop mode. Then, press the
**Track Assign** button for the track with the clip playing. You can also press the **Stop All Clips** button to stop clips in
all tracks.

In addition to launching clips in a track, you can launch multiple clips across tracks in the same row. Each row of clips is
called a _scene_, and these can be used to arrange different parts of a song.


Press the top-most **Scene Launch** button to launch the first row of clips, and then continue launching other scenes in
order.


While one scene is playing, try launching clips from other rows to experiment with different variations.


You can also assign Tracks to Force's crossfader. This allows you to seamlessly transition between clips from multiple
tracks.


1. Press and hold the **Assign A** button and press the **Track Assign** button for **Track 1 – Kick Loop** . The track name at
the top of the display will now show an **A** icon.


2. Next, press and hold the **Assign B** button and press the **Track Assign** button for **Track 4 – Hat Fill** . The track name
at the top of the display will show a **B** icon.


3. Launch the third scene and then use the crossfader to blend from one clip to the other by moving it from the A side
to the B side and back.


**To clear crossfader assignments,** hold **Shift** and press the **Assign A** or **Assign B** button.


**To edit the slope profile of the crossfader,** open the **Mixer Config** window by tapping **Settings** when viewing the Mixer,
or by holding **Shift** and pressing **Mute** or **Solo** . Select **Linear**, **Exponential** or **Logarithmic** .

**Editing Clips & Tracks**


Now that you are familiar with the basics of launching clips, let's explore some of the modes and menus that let you edit
clips and tracks for even more customization of your project.


In the **Clip Event Editor**, you can view and edit note events and their parameters, such as length,
velocity and transposition, for MIDI tracks and audio samples and their parameters, such as length,
volume and tuning, in Audio tracks.


For MIDI clips such as those in drum, keygroup or plugin tracks, use the toolbar at the top of the
display to add, erase, or select notes and move around the grid, and use the Edit menu to further
edit the MIDI note events.


For Audio clips, use the toolbar at the top of the display to select, move, erase, cut and mute parts
of the waveform below. This page also contains Force's powerful Warp tool, which can be used to
adjust the tempo of any sample to match your project's tempo without changing the pitch.


In the **Clip Editor**, you can view and edit the parameters of the clip container itself, such as its
length, launch mode and quantization. When using an audio clip, this view will show the waveform
of the sample. When using a MIDI clip, such as a drum kit clip or a plugin clip, this view will show
either all available pads in a vertical view with their corresponding data or a vertical “piano roll”
keyboard.


Additionally, MIDI clips can be edited using **List Edit Mode** . This mode gives you many of the same
features as the Clip Event Editor, but in a list workflow. You can use this view to filter your MIDI
events by a particular type, for instance, Aftertouch messages or Track Automation.


In **Arrange Mode**, you can record your clip performance to a linear timeline and use Force's
powerful Arrange Edit commands to shape your song. See _**Operation**_ _>_ _**Modes**_ _>_ _**Arrange Mode**_
to learn more.


Force's **Track Edit Mode** is used to edit the parameters of the track itself. This mode is not available
for audio tracks.


For drum tracks, you can edit the parameters of the four layers as well as all synthesis parameters
and insert effect settings.


For keygroup tracks, you can set the keygroup note ranges and edit the parameters of each
keygroup and set their note ranges. You can also edit all synthesis parameters and insert effect
settings.


For plugin tracks, you can parameters of the plugin using the graphic interface for built-in plugins,
or an overview of all plugin parameters with a slider for each for other plugins.


Each of these sections is explained in further detail below and in the _**Operation**_ _>_ _**Modes**_ chapter.

**Clip Editor**


First, let's look at the **Clip Editor**, where you can view and edit clip information and parameters.


**To enter the Clip Editor**, do either of the following:


  - Press **Clip** .


  - Press **Menu** and then tap **Clip Editor** .


In the Clip Editor, you can view and edit the parameters of the clip container itself, such as length, launch mode, and
quantization. The appearance of the Clip Editor depends on what kind of track the clip belongs to:


For audio tracks, the waveform of the audio clip is shown:


For drum tracks, the left column shows you all available pads in a
vertical view with their corresponding events in the grid to the right:


For keygroup, plugin, MIDI and CV tracks, the left column shows a
vertical “piano roll” keyboard with the corresponding events in the grid
to the right:

Let's edit one of the clips in our demo project:


1. Make sure the **clip launch pads** are in Launch Mode by pressing the **Launch** button.


2. Press and hold the **Select** button, then press the first clip launch pad for **Track 7 – SFX** .


3. Now, try making some of the edits to the clip described below. At any time, press **Undo** to revert to the previous state.


**To adjust the length of the clip,** use the **Start**, **Loop Start** and **Loop Length** fields **.** Alternatively, use the **Set**
**Start** and **Set End** buttons during playback. The start or end point will be placed at the position of the playhead
when the button was pressed.


**To adjust the launch quantization setting**, tap the **Launch Quantization** field, and then use the **data dial** or
**–/+** buttons to set the timing of how the clip is launched. This can be set separately from the global launch
quantization. For instance, you may keep the global launch quantization at **1 Bar** to keep longer clips in sync, but
set sound effects or other "one shots" to a smaller launch quantization, such as **1/8 Bar** .


**To change the clip launch behavior,** tap the **Launch Mode** field, and then use the **data dial** or **–/+** buttons to
change the mode. Select **Toggle** for the clip to start or stop with each successive press. Select **Trigger** for the
clip to start at the beginning with each press. Toggle is useful for clips of full phrases, whereas Trigger is useful
for one shot sound effects.


**To adjust the timing correction**, tap the **TC** button to open the Timing Correct window. This window contains
various settings to help quantize the events in your clip (learn about this feature in _**Operation**_ _>_ _**General Features**_

_>_ _**Timing Correct**_ _(_ _**TC**_ _)_ ).


**To trim an audio clip,** use the **Loop Length** field to set the preferred length, then tap **Trim Clip** to trim the whole
clip to this size.


**To carry the playhead position from one clip to another in the same track**, tap the **Legato** button. When
active, the playhead will continue from the same position as it was in the previous clip of the same track when
switching between clips. This is useful for creating seamless fills in drum breaks, working with an acapella track
or other scenarios where you would like a clip to play across multiple scenes.


**To enable or disable clip looping,** tap the **Looping** button. Clips like sound effects, drum hits and other "one
shots" should usually have **Loop** set to **Off** . For longer melodic or rhythmic phrases, set **Loop** to **On** .


**To adjust the loop**, hold **Shift** and tap the **<<Loop** or **Loop>>** buttons to shift the loop left or right, or hold **Shift**
and tap the **/2** or **2X** buttons to halve or double the loop size.

**Clip Event Editor**


In the Clip Event Editor (formerly _Grid Mode_, or _Region View_ for audio and _Event View_ for MIDI), you can edit parameters
of the audio clip itself, such as length, levels, tuning and BPM.


Let's start by making some edits to an audio clip using the Clip Event Editor.


1. Launch the first clip in **Track 1 – Kick Loop** .


2. Press **Menu** and tap **Grid** .


3. Now, try making some of the edits to the audio clip described below. At any time, press **Undo** to revert to the previous
state.


**To select part of the clip**, tap the **select box** icon in the upper-right corner, then tap and drag in the lower-half
of the waveform.


**To move all or part of the clip**, tap the **pointer** icon in the upper-right corner, and then tap and drag at the top
part of the waveform.


**To shorten or lengthen a clip region** (or multiple selected clip regions), tap the **select box** or **pointer** icons in
the upper-right corner, and then tap and drag the lower third of it left or right.


**To split the clip into multiple parts,** tap the **scissors** icon in the upper-right corner, and then tap anywhere in
the waveform.


**To mute all or part of a clip,** tap the **speaker** icon in the upper-right corner, and then tap in the waveform.
Alternatively, select the part of the waveform you want to mute, and then press the **Mute** button.


**To scroll through or change the zoom level of the waveform**, tap the **magnifying glass** icon. Then, tap and
drag to scroll through the waveform, pinch with two fingers to zoom out, or spread with two fingers to zoom in.


**To change the level of the clip**, tap the **Level** field, and then use the **data dial** or **–/+** buttons.


**To change the tuning of the clip**, tap **Semi** or **Fine**, and then use the **data dial** or **–/+** buttons.


**To reverse the clip (or a section of it)**, tap the **Reverse** button.


**To rename the clip,** tap the **keyboard icon** under the waveform, then use the keyboard on the display to enter a
new name.

In the Clip Event Editor, you can also use Force's powerful warp tool to adjust the tempo of any sample to match your
project's tempo without changing the pitch.


**To sync an audio clip to the project tempo:**


1. Load the desired sample to an empty clip launch pad using the
**Browser** .


2. With the clip launch pad selected, open the **Clip Event Editor** by
pressing **Menu** and tapping **Grid** .


3. If your sample is already cut to a set number of bars and beats, you
can continue to the next step.


If your sample is not already evenly cut, you can use the **Edit Start**
and **Edit End** tools to isolate the section of the sample you would
like to use. Alternatively, use the **scissors** icon to cut the audio.


4. Tap the **Warp** button to enable warping of the sample. This will
allow you to lengthen or shorten the selected clip region to the
desired loop length without changing the sample pitch.


5. To adjust the BPM of the sample, tap the **Detect** button to open
the **Edit BPM** window. From here, you can set the BPM in one of
three ways:


i. Press **Detect** to have Force analyze the BPM for you.


ii. Play the clip and use the **Tap Tempo** button to input the BPM.


iii. Enter the BPM manually if you know it.


6. As the BPM of the sample is changed, the number of bars and
beats it covers will also change.


See _**Operation**_ _>_ _**Modes**_ _>_ _**Clip Event Editor**_ to learn more about this feature.

**To erase a note,** tap the **Eraser** icon in the upper-right corner. Then, in the grid, tap a note.


**To select a note,** tap the **select box** in the upper-right corner. Then, in the grid, tap a note. You can also drag
your finger to select multiple notes.


**To move the selected notes**, tap **Nudge** at the bottom of the screen, and then use the **data dial** or **–** / **+** buttons
to shift the notes left or right. By default, you can position notes only by quantization values defined by the **Time**
**Correct** value (learn about this feature in _**Operation**_ _>_ _**General Features**_ _>_ _**Timing Correct**_ _(_ _**TC**_ _)_ ).


**To adjust the start point or end point of the selected notes** (without changing their position), tap **Edit Start** or
**Edit End** at the bottom of the screen, and then use the **data dial o** r **–** / **+** buttons.


**To transpose the selected notes up or down**, tap **Transpose** at the bottom of the screen, and then use the
**data dial o** r **–** / **+** buttons.


**To adjust the velocity of the selected notes**, tap **Velocity** at the bottom of the screen, and then use the **data**
**dial o** r **–** / **+** buttons. The numeric value will appear on the screen.


**To show the automation lane**, tap the **up arrow** ( ∧ ) button in the lower-right corner of the screen to show the
automation lane below the grid. By default, the Velocity parameter is shown, with each note’s velocity represented
by a vertical bar. The higher and more red the bar is, the higher the velocity is. Double-tap the **Velocity** field to
add a new automation parameter. See _**Addenda > Updates in Force 3.0.3**_ _>_ _**New Features**_ _>_ _**Grid/Automation**_
_**Lanes**_ for more information.


When the automation lane is expanded, the **up arrow** ( ∧ ) button will turn into a **down arrow** ( ∨ ) button, which you
can then tap to hide the automation lane.
