**Keygroup Tracks**


A keygroup track uses one or more samples as its sound source. It contains ( **1** ) a list of samples and ( **2** ) the settings for
each sample (i.e., pitch tuning, effects, etc.). Keygroup tracks are used to play samples chromatically with a MIDI keyboard
or the Force pads.


**To create a keygroup track** :


1. Press **Matrix** to enter Clip Matrix Mode.


2. At the top of the screen, press the **+ icon** to add a new track.


If you cannot see the **+ icon**, press the **right cursor** to move the matrix view
until it is shown.


3. Tap **Keygroup** to instantly create a new track. For more track options, tap
the **Advanced** button and select **Keygroup** as the track **type** in the window
that appears.


If you would like to create more than one keygroup track at once, use the
**Number of tracks** field to select how many tracks you would like to create.


4. Tap **Do It** to confirm, or tap **Close**, the **X** or outside the window to go back.
A new keygroup track will be created and appended with a number (e.g.,
**Keygroup 002** ).


Alternatively, press and hold the **track select** button of an unused track, then tap **Keygroup** .

**Note:** If you are unsure of your audio interface’s compatibility, check with the original equipment manufacturer for more
information.

**Audio Device:** This determines whether you are using the **Internal** sound device, or a selected class-compliant audio
interface connected to your Force hardware.

**32 Inputs/Outputs:** Check this box to enable use of up to 32 simultaneous inputs and outputs.

**Note:** Increasing the number of simultaneous inputs and outputs will also increase CPU overhead.


**Audio/Export**


The settings on this screen determine the audio recording and exporting settings.

**Enable Disk Streaming:** This determines whether disk streaming is enabled or disabled. See _**Addenda**_ _>_ _**Updates**_
_**in Force 3.1**_ _>_ _**New Features**_ _>_ _**Disk Streaming**_ to learn more.

**Recording Bit Depth:** This determines the bit depth of recorded audio.

**Bounce/Extract Bit Depth:** This determines the bit depth of audio bounced or extracted.

**Audio Warp Algorithm** : This determines how a sample is “warped” when you adjust the length of a sample without
changing its pitch (e.g., the **Warp** function in Audio Region Edit Mode for audio tracks or in Track Edit Mode for clip tracks).

**Note** : The Warp algorithms are very CPU-intensive and can result in audio drop-outs during playback if used too
freely. Be mindful of how (and how often) you use the warp function. You can reduce the CPU resources required by
using the **Basic** warp algorithm, which is less CPU-intensive.

**Audio Track Auto Warp** : This determines how recorded audio track regions are warped. When set to **On**, any audio
track region that you record will be warped automatically to match the current project tempo. You can then adjust the
project tempo while the audio track region remains in time.

**Note** : When you record an audio file, the current project tempo will be embedded with it. This information is stored
within the sample file when you save the project. When you warp an audio track region, the warping algorithm uses
this project tempo and the current value in the **BPM** field to generate the “stretch factor.”

**BPM Auto Detection:** This enables automatic detection of BPM from loaded samples.

**BPM Detection Range** : This defines the range of detectable BPM values when you use any automatic BPM detection
function in the software or when you press the **Tap** button to enter a new tempo.

custom name. When **Global** is enabled, MIDI data from this port will always go to the current track. When **Control** is
enabled, MIDI data from this port will be sent to MIDI Learn. When **Track** is enabled, this MIDI port will appear in the
list of available MIDI Inputs. Click the **reset arrow** to reset the MDI Port settings.


**Output Ports:** This displays all available MIDI output ports in a list. Double-tap the **keyboard icon** to rename a port
to a custom name. When **Sync** is enabled, the MIDI output port will send MIDI sync messages according to the type
set under Sync _**Send**_, below. When **Track** is enabled, this MIDI port will appear in the list of available track MIDI
outputs. Click the **reset arrow** to reset the MDI Port settings.


**Enable MIDI Ports When Discovered:** This determines whether the **Track** option is automatically enabled when any
MIDI device is plugged in, enabling the ports to be selected as an available MIDI input or output immediately.


**Receive** : This determines whether your Force hardware receives MIDI Clock information ( **MIDI Clock** ), MIDI Time Code
information ( **MIDI Time Code** ( **MTC** )), communication from Ableton Link ( **Ableton Link** ), or none of these ( **Off** ).


**Important** : Audio recording is disabled when receiving MIDI Clock sync. Use MIDI Time Code to record audio while
receiving MIDI sync.


**Receive MMC** : When enabled, your Force hardware will be able to receive MIDI Machine Control (MMC) information.
When disabled, your Force hardware will not receive this information. See _**Appendix**_ _>_ _**MIDI Machine Control**_ _(_ _**MMC**_ _)_
to learn about this.


**Send** : This determines whether your Force hardware sends MIDI Clock information ( **MIDI Clock** ), MIDI Time Code
information ( **MIDI Time Code** ( **MTC** )), or neither ( **Off** ).


**Send MMC** : When enabled, your Force hardware will be able to send MIDI Machine Control (MMC) information. When
disabled, your Force hardware will not send this information. See _**Appendix**_ _>_ _**MIDI Machine Control**_ _(_ _**MMC**_ _)_ to learn
about this.


**MTC Frame Rate** : This determines the frame rate used by MIDI Time Code (MTC), which is important for correct
timing, especially when working on film scoring projects. In most cases, you should select **25** .


**Start Time** : This is the starting time that will be sent when **Send MIDI** is set to anything other than **Off** . The time is
formatted in **hours** : **minutes** : **seconds** : **frames** .


**Filter** ‘ **All Notes Off** ’ **CC** : When enabled, “All Notes Off” (“MIDI panic”) messages will be ignored. This is useful if you
are using an external MIDI device that can send these types of messages but you want to filter them out. When
disabled, “All Notes Off” messages will be received normally.


**Program Change** : This determines whether incoming MIDI Program Change messages will change the **Sequence**,
**Track**, or be ignored ( **Off** ).


**Hardware**


The settings on this screen determine the behavior of your Force hardware’s pads and touchscreen.


**Pad Brightness:** This determines the overall brightness of Force's clip matrix pads.


**Empty Slots:** This determines how the clip launch pads appear when no clip is loaded.


**Track Select Buttons:** This determines the behavior of the Track Select buttons


**Pad Threshold** : This determines how much force is required to strike the pads for them to trigger.



**Pad Sensitivity** : This determines how the pads respond to touch. At lower values, you need
to use more force to generate a high-velocity note. At higher values, it is easier to generate
high-velocity notes, even if you do not use much force while pressing a pad.


**Pad Curve** : This determines how striking the pads translates into velocity values. The **A** curve
is essentially linear, while the **B**, **C**, and **D** curves are exponential (see graphic here).


**Velocity** & **Aftertouch** : View these meters when striking and pressing the pads to help
gauge the force and pressure you are applying to them. These meters are useful when
adjusting the Pad Threshold and Pad Sensitivity parameters (above).


**Screen Dimming** : This determines how much time must pass before your Force hardware
automatically dims its screen.
