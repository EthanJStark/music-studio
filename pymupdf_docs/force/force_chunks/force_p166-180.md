1. Tap the up **arrow** ( ∧ ) button in the lower-right corner to show the velocity/automation lane.


2. Tap the **down** **arrow** ( ∨ ) to hide the velocity/automation lane.


When editing velocity, each note’s velocity is represented by a vertical bar. The higher and more red the bar is, the higher
the velocity is. Yellow bars indicate a lower velocity. Bars with a gray line at the top indicate a currently selected note.


**To adjust the velocity of the selected notes**, tap **Velocity** at the bottom of the screen, and then use the **data dial** or
**–/+** buttons.


**To add automation to a clip:**


1. Select a **MIDI Track** or **Audio Track**, and then press **Menu** and tap **Grid** to open the Clip Event Editor.


2. Tap the **up arrow** on the parameter bar to expand the velocity/automation lane.


3. By default, **Velocity** is shown in this lane for MIDI tracks and **TRK: Volume** is shown for Audio tracks. Double-tap this
field to open the **Parameter** drop-down menu.


4. In the menu that appears, tap **Add New** to add an automation parameter. You can choose from a variety of parameters
depending on the type of track, insert effects added and other options.


**To edit automation,** do any of the following in the Clip Event Editor or Clip Editor:


 - Use the **pencil** tool to draw your automation in the automation lane.


 - Use the **eraser** tool to erase automation points. If you erase all automation points, the parameter will be removed.


 - Tap the **trash can icon** to delete all automation for the selected parameter at once.

**Step Sequencer**


The Step Sequencer lets you create or edit clips by using the pads as “step buttons,” simulating the
experience of a traditional step-sequencer-style drum machine. This is available for MIDI tracks only, not
audio tracks.


You can also create and edit automation using the Step Sequencer.


**To enter the Step Sequencer**, press **Menu**, and then tap **Step Sequencer** . If you have not yet created a clip for the track,
you will be prompted to do so.


**Note:** Entering the Step Sequencer mode on the display will not also put the **clip launch pads** into their own Step
Sequencer pad mode. Press the **Step Seq** button to do so.


The top of the screen shows the track name and information as well as project and timing information.


The **Track** field shows the name of the current track.


Use the **BPM** field to adjust the tempo of the project.


The time counter at the top of the screen indicates the current playhead position.

**To enter or delete steps in a clip** :


1. Use the **Pad –** / **+** buttons at the bottom of the screen to select the pad whose steps you want to enter or delete. The
current pad number is shown in the upper-left corner.


2. Use the **Bar –** / **+** buttons at the bottom of the screen to select the bar of the clip whose steps you want to enter or
delete. The current bar number is shown in the upper-left corner.


3. Press the **pads** of your Force hardware, or tap a button at the bottom of the sequencer. Each pad corresponds to a
step in the bar and will light with a color corresponding to its velocity.


For time divisions larger than 16, the bar’s steps will be represented by multiple pad banks. In this
case, use the left and right arrows ( **<** and **>** ) by the step numbers ( **1** - **16**, **17** - **32**, etc.) to change which
steps are shown in the sequencer.


**To adjust the velocities of the steps**, do any of the following:


  - Tap anywhere on the **velocity bar** of a step. The top of the velocity bar will jump to that point.


  - Use the **slider** on the right edge of the screen to increase or decrease the velocities of all steps.


Use the **Nudge <** and **Nudge >** arrows to shift the entire pattern left or right (respectively) by one step. This is useful for
experimenting with different rhythmic permutations.


Use the **slider** on the right edge of the screen to increase or decrease the velocities of all steps.


Use the **Flip Steps** button to switch which steps have notes entered and which do not have notes. Steps
that previously had no notes will now have notes at full velocity ( **127** ). Steps that previously had notes will
now be empty.

Tap **Presets** to show or hide the preset velocity controls. These controls let you manipulate and transform
the velocities of the current bar in the clip.


The **first** button will apply ascending or descending velocities to the steps. Each time you tap it, it will cycle
through these options:


  - The velocities will ascend to a single peak at the end of the bar.


  - The velocities will ascend to two peaks—one after each half of the bar.


  - The velocities will ascend to four peaks—one after each quarter of the bar.


  - The velocities will descend from a single peak at the start of the bar.


  - The velocities will descend from two peaks—one after each half of the bar.


  - The velocities will descend from four peaks—one at the start each quarter of the bar.


The **second** button will set the velocities of the steps to be at the maximum value ( **127** ) or minimum values
( **1** ), depending on their position in the bar. Each time you tap it, it will cycle through these options:


  - The velocities of the first half of the bar will be set to **1** . The velocities of the second half will be set
to **127** .


  - The velocities of the first and third quarters of the bar will be set to **1** . The velocities of the second
and fourth quarters will be set to **127** .


  - The velocities of the first, third, fifth, and seventh eighths of the bar will be set to **1** . The velocities
of the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth eighths will be set to **127** .


  - The velocities of the first half of the bar will be set to **127** . The velocities of the second half will be
set to **1** .


  - The velocities of the first and third quarters of the bar will be set to **127** . The velocities of the second
and fourth quarters will be set to **1** .


  - The velocities of the first, third, fifth, and seventh eighths of the bar will be set to **127** . The velocities
of the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth eighths will be set to **1** .


The **third** button will apply ascending or descending velocities to the steps. Each time you tap it, it will cycle
through these options:


  - Across the entire bar, the velocities will ascend to a peak and then descend from it.


  - In each half of the bar, the velocities will ascend to a peak and then descend from it.


  - In each quarter of the bar, the velocities will ascend to a peak and then descend from it.


  - Across the entire bar, the velocities will descend from a peak into a valley and then ascend back up to
the peak.


  - In each half of the bar, the velocities will descend from a peak into a valley and then ascend back up
to the peak.


  - In each quarter of the bar, the velocities will descend from a peak into a valley and then ascend
back up to the peak.


The **fourth** button will swap the first half and second half of the bar. In other words, the first half of the bar
will become a mirrored image of the second half, and vice versa.

## Page 179

The **fifth** button will invert the velocities of all steps with entered notes. The sum of the old and new
velocities will equal **127** . The exception is a velocity of **127** or **1** as a step with a note cannot have a velocity
of **0** .


**Examples** :


Steps with velocities of **40** will now have velocities of **87**, and vice versa.


Steps with velocities of **75** will now have velocities of **52**, and vice versa.


Steps with velocities of **127** will now have velocities of **1**, and vice versa.


**Step Automation**


You can also create and edit automation using the Step Sequencer.


**To add a step automation parameter:**


1. Press **Menu** and tap **Step Sequencer** to open the Step
Sequencer.


2. By default, the **Parameter** field of the Step Sequencer
displays **Velocity** for MIDI tracks and **TRK: Volume** for
audio tracks. Double-tap this field to open the drop-down
menu.


3. In the menu that appears, tap **Add New** to add an
automation parameter. You can choose from a variety of
parameters depending on the type of track, insert effects
added and other options.


**To edit step automation,** do any of the following:


 - Tap and drag your finger in the step area to freely draw step values.


 - Press and hold the **Knobs** button and tap **Screen** to set the knobs to Screen Mode. While viewing the step sequencer,
you can use the knobs for tactile control of each step's automation value, emulating traditional knob-based step
sequencers. Use **Bank 1** of the knobs to control **Steps 1**   - **8** and **Bank 2** to control **Steps 9**   - **16** . While it is being
adjusted, the current automation value will be shown next to the **Parameter** field, as well as in the display strip above
the knobs.


 - Press and hold **Shift** and tap **Clear** to clear all automation for the selected parameter in the selected clip.


 - Press and hold **Shift** and tap **Clear Bar** to clear all automation for the selected parameter in the current bar of the
selected clip.


 - Use the **Nudge <** and **>** buttons to shift the current automation parameter to the left or right at the current Timing
Correct value.


 - Use the **slider** on the right side to increase or decrease the parameter values for all automation steps in the visible
time range.


 - Tap **Presets** and use the buttons to apply the presets to the step automation (See _**Operation**_ _>_ _**Modes**_ _>_ _**Step**_
_**Sequencer**_ for more information).


**Note:** When editing step automation, if a step is not activated, a darkened step bar will indicate the current parameter
value at that step, based on the last active step.
