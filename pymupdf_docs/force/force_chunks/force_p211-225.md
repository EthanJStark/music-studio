The **second** **Envelope** tab contains the filter modulation envelope.


Use the **Type** field to select a filter for the selected pad. See _**Appendix**_ _>_ _**Glossary**_ _>_ _**Filter**_ for an explanation of the
available filter types.


Use the **Cutoff** knob to set the cutoff frequency for low-pass and high-pass filter types or the center frequency for bandpass and band-stop filter types.


Use the **Reso** knob to set the resonance/emphasis of the frequencies around the cutoff point.


**Tip** : Use values lower than **80** to give more brilliance to the sound. At values higher than **80**, the sound will result in a
strong audible boost around the cutoff frequency.


The **Filter Envelope** controls affect the filter frequency. Use the fields or tap and drag the “handles” of the envelope to
shape the envelope or time-variant modulation output. Adjust the envelope’s influence on the filter frequency with the
**Depth** knob. See the later _**Anatomy of an Envelope**_ section to learn about the envelope parameters.


Use the **Depth** slider to determine the amount of influence the filter envelope has on the cutoff frequency. Higher settings
will increase the modulation of the filter by the envelope; lower settings will result in only subtle changes of the filter **Cutoff**
over time.


**Tip** : **To give a sound a more distinctive attack**, increase the **Depth** setting and set low **Atk** and **Decay** values as well
as a medium-low **Sust** value of the **Filter Envelope** . This will start a sound with the filter opened and close it shortly
afterward, giving it a bright start followed by a darker sustain. String sounds, on the other hand, can sound much more
“alive” with low **Depth** settings and a high **Atk** value, resulting in a slight fade-in of the higher frequencies.


The **Velocity Modulation** controls determine how much the velocity affects the cutoff frequency of the filter envelope
( **Cutoff** ), the attack phase of the filter envelope ( **Attack** ), and/or depth of influence the filter envelope has on the cutoff
frequency ( **Depth** ).


When you press a pad softly, only minimal modulation is applied. When you press it harder, the modulation amount also
gets stronger depending on the setting of the corresponding slider.

The **third** **Envelope** tab contains the pitch modulation envelope.


**Global Semi** lets you transpose the keygroup up to 36 semitones up or down. This will affect the length of the sample (if
**Warp** is off). This is the same as the **Semi** field on the **Global** tab.


**Global Fine** provides fine-tuning of each layer by cents. This will affect the length of the sample (if **Warp** is off). This is the
same as the **Fine** field on the **Global** tab.


The **Pitch Envelope** controls affect the keygroups’s pitch change over time. Use the fields or tap and drag the “handles”
of the envelope to shape the envelope or time-variant modulation output. Adjust the envelope’s influence on the pitch
with the **Depth** slider. See the later _**Anatomy of an Envelope**_ section to learn about the envelope parameters.


The **Velocity Modulation** control determines how much the velocity affects the pitch envelope ( **Pitch** ).


When you press a pad softly, only minimal modulation is applied. When you press it harder, the modulation amount also
gets stronger depending on the setting of the **Pitch** slider.

**LFO**


A low-frequency oscillator (LFO) generates a periodic waveform with an adjustable frequency and shape which can be
used for modulation purposes.


Use the **Waveform** field to select the LFO waveform type:


  - **Sine** (best suited for smooth modulations)


  - **Triangle** (best suited for smooth modulations)


  - **S&H** (samples a random value and holds it until the next value is generated)


  - **Saw** (can generate interesting filter or volume changes)


  - **Saw Down** (can generate interesting filter or volume changes)


  - **Square** (interesting results with hard-panning modulations)


  - **Noise** (generates random values and glides)


Use the **Rate** field to determine the LFO frequency. At lower values, it might take some time for the LFO to complete a
cycle, while higher values will come closer to audible range.


Use the **Sync** field to set if the LFO’s rate is synchronized with the tempo. You can select one of several time divisions
(a **.** indicates a dotted note; a **T** indicates a triplet-based time division). When **None** is selected, **Sync** is off.


Use the **Destinations** sliders to determine how much the LFO affects the pitch of the sound ( **Pitch** ), the cutoff frequency
of the filter ( **Filter** ), the volume level of the sound ( **Amp** ) and panning of the sound ( **Pan** ).

**Porta/Mod**


Use the **Portamento** fields to adjust the settings for pitch gliding.


The **Time** slider sets the length of the glide between notes.


Tap the **Quantize** button to synchronize the portamento time with the project tempo.


Tap the **Legato** button to enable or disable pitch gliding for all triggered notes or just legato notes.


Use the **Velocity Sensitivity** sliders to set how much velocity is required to modulate certain other parameters:


  - **Pitch** enables velocity information to control the pitch of the sample.


  - **Amp Attack** sets how much velocity is needed (for a triggered pad) to modulate the Attack phase for the Amp
envelope.


  - **Amp** enables velocity information to control the overall amplitude (level) of the sample.


  - **Pan** enables velocity information to control the stereo panning of the sample.


  - **KB>FLT** sets how much the note value will be added to the filter cutoff. This allows samples to sound brighter as they
are played higher on the keyboard.


  - **Filter Env Attack** sets how much velocity is needed (for a triggered pad) to modulate the Attack phase for the
Filter envelope.


  - **Filter Env Depth** enables velocity information to control the amount of the filter envelope’s effect on the cutoff
frequency.


  - **Filter Cutoff** uses the velocity of a pad to modulate the cutoff frequency directly.


The **Controller Mod** section determines the influence of additional play controllers on various sound parameters.


**Important** : To use these parameters, make sure that a connected MIDI device can send pitch bend messages as well as
aftertouch and modulation wheel data.


**Pitch Bend** sets the range (in semitones) of a connected MIDI keyboard’s pitch-bend wheel.


**Wheel**  - **LFO** determines how much a connected MIDI keyboard’s modulation wheel affects the LFO intensity.


**Aft**   - **Filt** (Aftertouch  Filter Cutoff) determines how much a connected MIDI keyboard’s aftertouch data affects the
filter cutoff.

**Effects**


**Inserts**


You can select up to four insert effects for each keygroup. To learn how to use insert effects, please see _**General Features**_

_>_ _**Effects**_ _>_ _**Insert Effects**_ .


**Important** : When using keygroup insert effects, they will be applied to that keygroup only. Keep this in mind if you load
insert effects to multiple keygroups with overlapping note ranges—the effects will overlap in that range as well.


**To add an effect** :


1. Double-tap the desired **Inserts** slot. A list of effects will appear.


2. Swipe up or down to move through the list.


You can tap the **Type** and **Manufacturer** buttons to sort your effects by those categories.


3. **To load an effect**, double-tap it, or tap **Select** .


**To close the list**, tap **Close** .


**To remove an effect from its slot**, tap the **trash can icon** .


**To enable or disable the effect**, tap the **On** / **Off** button for the slot.


**To enable or disable all four insert effects**, tap the **All** **On** / **Off** button in the upper-right corner.


**To rearrange an insert effect,** tap the arrows next to the insert slot to move the selected effect up or down.


**To load a factory FX rack,** tap the **Akai folder** icon. You can choose from a number of preset combinations of insert
effects by applications like Drums and Percussion, Voice, LoFi, Mastering, and more.


**To load a saved FX rack,** tap second **folder** icon.


**To save an FX rack,** tap the **disk** icon.

**To adjust the effect’s parameters**, tap the **pencil icon** . Use the controls to set the value of each parameter. These values
affect only this instance of the effect; insert effects are not global.


**To load an effect preset,** tap the **folder** icon next to the preset name at the top of the display to open the file browser.


**To save a new effect preset,** tap the **disk** icon next to the insert selector at the top of the display.


**Sends**


The audio of the track will be routed to send effects (if you have any loaded) at their designated send levels. The return
channels will then send the audio to an assigned main output at the designated return levels.


Use the **Send** knobs to set the volume level of the signal the track will route to each send effect.


You can select up to four send effects for each keygroup, but remember that they will be applied to that keygroup only.
Keep this in mind if you load insert effects to multiple keygroups with overlapping note ranges—the effects will overlap in
that range as well.


**Important** : **To use a send effect**, you have to load an effect into the corresponding send effect slot in the Mixer. See _**General**_
_**Features**_ _>_ _**Effects**_ _>_ _**Send**_ _/_ _**Return Effects**_ to learn more how to do this.

**Anatomy of an Envelope**


An envelope creates a variable control signal. It can be used, for instance, to modulate the filter settings of a sound over
a given period of time.


For drum tracks, use the **AD** / **AHDS** selector to select an AD or AHDS envelope. When **Sample Play** is set to **Note-On**, it
will use an ADSR envelope.


Keygroup tracks always use **AHDS** envelopes. When **Sample Play** is set to **Note-On**, it will use an **ADSR** envelope.


With **AHDS** envelopes, the following happens when you trigger a
sample:


1. Within the period of time you have defined with the attack ( **Atk** ), the
sample volume rises to its maximum value.


2. The sample’s maximum volume will be maintained during the **Hold**
phase.


3. During the **Decay** phase, the sample’s volume will gradually drop
to the sustain level.


4. The sample’s volume will stay at the sustain level ( **Sust** ) until the
pad is released.


Use the **A Shape** and **D Shape** fields to adjust the curve of the **Attack**
and **Decay** phases, respectively.


With **AD** envelopes, the following happens when you trigger a sample:


1. Within the period of time you have defined with the attack ( **Atk** ), the
sample volume rises to its maximum value.


2. The sample’s maximum volume will be maintained until its **Decay**
phase, when the sample’s volume will gradually drop to zero over the
set duration. Tap the **Type** drop-down menu to select how the decay
functions:


    - **Decay From Start** : The volume will start decreasing
immediately after reaching its maximum level.


    - **Decay From End** : The maximum volume will be maintained
for a hold phase until it reaches the decay phase.


Use the **A Shape** and **D Shape** fields to adjust the curve of the **Attack**
and **Decay** phases, respectively.


With **ADSR** envelopes, the following happens when you trigger a
sample:


1. Within the period of time defined by **Attack**, the sample volume
rises to its maximum value.


2. During the **Decay** phase, the sample’s volume will gradually drop
to the **Sustain** level.


3. The sample’s volume will stay at the **Sustain** level until the note is
released.


4. The sample’s volume will drop to “zero” over the duration set by
**Release** .


Use the **A Shape**, **D Shape** and **R Shape** fields to adjust the curve of
the **Attack**, **Decay** and **Release** phases, respectively.

**Play Sample** ( **One Shot** ) ( **Pad 10** ) plays the sample once from the start point to the end point. Press the pad once to
play it.

**Play Sample** ( **Note On** ) ( **Pad 11** ) plays the sample once from the start point to the end point. Press and hold the pad
to play it, and release the pad to stop playing it. Alternatively, select the **headphones icon** in the upper-right corner,
and then tap and hold your finger on the waveform.

**Play Loop Continuous** ( **Pad 16** ) plays the sample repeatedly using the mode set by the **Loop** button ( **Forward**,
**Reverse**, or **Alternating** ; if the **Loop** button is **off**, the sample will loop forward repeatedly).

**Play Loop** ( **Pad 13** ) plays the sample repeatedly using the mode set by the **Loop** button ( **Forward**, **Reverse**, or
**Alternating** ; if the **Loop** button is off, the sample will loop forward repeatedly). Press and hold the pad to play it, and
release the pad to stop playing it.

**Play to Loop Start** ( **Pad 14** ) plays the part of the sample just before the loop point. Press and hold the pad to play it,
and release the pad to stop playing it.

**Play from Loop Start** ( **Pad 15** ) plays the sample from the loop point to the end of the sample regardless of the end
point. Press and hold the pad to play it, and release the pad to stop playing it.

**Play All** ( **Pad 9** ) plays the entire sample.


**Pads 1** - **4** have the same respective functions as **Pads 5** - **8**, but **Pads 1** - **4** play the sample part as “ **One Shots** ” (pressing
the pad once will play the entire part) while **Pads 5** - **8** play the sample part as “ **Note Ons** ” (pressing the pad and holding
it will play the part; releasing it will stop playback):

**Play from Start** ( **Pad 1**, **Pad 5** ) plays the sample from the start point to the end point.

**Play to Start** ( **Pad 2**, **Pad 6** ) plays the part of the sample just before the start point to the start point.

**Play to End** ( **Pad 3**, **Pad 7** ) plays the part of the sample just before the end point to the end point.

**Play from End** ( **Pad 4**, **Pad 8** ) plays the part of the sample from the end point to the end of the sample.


When in Chop Sample Edit Mode, you can use the lower-left quadrant of pads to add slices to the current sample or
trigger existing slices.


When the current Track is a Drum Track and Pad Sample Edit Mode is selected, you can use the lower-left quadrant of
pads to audition the current sample of the current pad, similar to using Notes mode with a Drum Track.

The upper half of the screen shows the waveform. The lower half shows the editing controls.


The waveform display shows the “active” section of the sample waveform. Swipe left or right on the waveform to move
through it.


Above the waveform is the timeline, shown in **Samples**, **Time** (in seconds and milliseconds), or **Beats** . You can select the
measurement units you want to show in the _**Settings**_ .


**To zoom in or out**, do any of the following:


  - When the **magnifying-glass icon** (in the upper-right corner) is selected, spread or pinch your fingers (respectively)
on the waveform.


  - Tap the **Zoom +** or **Zoom –** buttons (respectively) at the bottom of the screen.


  - Turn **Knob 8** when the knobs are set to **screen** mode.


**To scroll through the waveform**, do either of the following:


  - When the **magnifying-glass icon** (in the upper-right corner) is selected, swipe the waveform left or right.


  - Turn **Knob 7** when the knobs are set to **screen** mode.


The green marker and red marker are the start point and end point (respectively). These two points define the region of
the sample that will be played.


**To move the start point or end point of the selected region**, do any of the following:


  - Tap and drag its marker left or right.


  - Use the **Start** or **End** fields shown below the waveform.


  - When the **knobs** are set to **screen** mode, use **Knobs 1** and **2** to adjust the start point or **Knobs 3** and **4** to adjust
the end point. Knobs 1 and 3 provide fine adjustment and Knobs 2 and 4 provide coarse adjustment.


**Tip** : A recorded sample may have some silence at the beginning or end, which makes it difficult to time it correctly in a
musical context. Fix this by adjusting the start point. You can also adjust end point to remove any extra silence or
unwanted audio at the end. In addition to making your workflow easier, having a “tight,” well-edited sample can enhance
your production or performance.


You can use Sample Edit Mode in two different ways: **Trim Mode** or **Chop Mode** . The options for each mode are slightly
different. Please refer to the following _**Trim Mode**_ and _**Chop Mode**_ parts of this chapter to learn how each works. Before
using these modes, though, you may want to configure your settings—see the following _**Settings**_ chapter to do this.

## Page 224

**Settings**


The Settings window lets you configure certain Sample Edit Mode settings.


**To view the Settings**, tap the **gear icon** .


Use the **Cue Play Mode** selector to set how the cue playhead will play audio.


  - **One Shot** : Tapping **Play Cue** will play the entire sample from the cue playhead.


  - **Toggle** : Tapping **Play Cue** once will start playback from cue playhead. Tapping it once more will stop playback.


Use the **Cue Preview** selector to set if any audio plays as you move the cue playhead. As you move the cue playhead
through the sample waveform, you can set it to play the small part of the sample before the cue playhead ( **Before** ), play
the small part of the sample after the cue playhead ( **After** ), or not play at all ( **Off** ). You can also set this in your overall
Preferences (see _**General Features**_ _>_ _**Menu**_ _>_ _**Preferences**_ _>_ _**General**_ ).


Use the **Slice Preview** selector to set if any audio plays as you move a slice marker. As you move the slice marker through
the sample waveform, you can set it to play the small part of the sample before the slice marker ( **Before** ), play the small
part of the sample after the slice marker ( **After** ), or not play at all ( **Off** ). You can also set this in your overall Preferences
(see _**General Features**_ _>_ _**Menu**_ _>_ _**Preferences**_ _>_ _**General**_ ).


Use the **Auto-Scroll** selector to set how the screen behaves relative to the audio playhead.


  - **Follow** : Depending on the zoom setting, the waveform will scroll along in the background, keeping the audio
playhead centered.


  - **Page** : The waveform display will move to the “next page” to follow the audio playhead.


  - **Off** : The waveform display will not move at all.


These functions also apply to the sample waveform in the Clip Event Editor.


Use the **Timeline Units** selector to set the measurement units shown above the sample waveform. You can select one of
the following options:


  - **Time** : hours:minutes:seconds:frames


  - **Samples** : number of samples


  - **Beats** : bars:beats:ticks

**Trim Mode**


We recommend using Trim Mode to crop the start and/or ends from a sample.


**To enter Trim Mode**, tap the **Trim** / **Chop** button in the lower-left corner so it says **Trim** . There are two pages of parameters
in Trim Mode, which can be accessed by tapping the **>** or **<** arrows on the sides of the page.


Use the **Start** and **End** fields to set the position of the start point and end point of the sample (respectively). Alternatively,
tap and drag the start ( **S** ) or end ( **E** ) marker left or right, or use **Knobs 1** and **2** to adjust the start point or **Knobs 3** and **4**
to adjust the end point when the knobs are in **screen** mode.


Trim Mode includes a loop function. When on, the region of the sample between the loop point and end point will repeat. This
is useful when trying to find an ideal spot to begin the sample. The loop cannot be earlier than the start point.


**To adjust the loop point**, do any of the following:


  - Use the **Loop** field.


  - Tap and drag the start ( **S** ) marker (if **Loop Lock** is on) or the **loop** marker (if **Loop Lock** is off).


  - When the **knobs** are in **screen** mode, use Knobs 5 and 6 to adjust the loop marker. Knob 5 provides fine
adjustment and Knob 6 provides coarse adjustment.


**To turn Loop Lock on or off**, tap the **Loop Lock** button. When on, the loop point is the same as the start point. When
off, the loop point is independent from the start point and indicated by a separate loop marker.


**To turn the loop function on or off**, tap the **Loop** button to cycle between the four modes:


  - **Off** : The sample will not loop.


  - **Forward** : When the loop reaches its end point, it will start playing again from the loop point.


  - **Reverse** : When the loop reaches its end point, it will play in reverse. When it reaches the loop point again, it will
return to the end point and continue playing in reverse.


  - **Alternating** : When the loop reaches its end point, it will play in reverse. When it reaches the loop point again, it
will start playing forward again from the loop point.


**To switch between Forward and off**, press and hold **Shift**, and then tap **Loop** at the bottom of the screen.
