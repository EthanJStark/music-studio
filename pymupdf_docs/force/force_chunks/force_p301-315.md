**AIR Transient**


This effect is used to enhance or soften the Attack and **Parameter** **Value Range** **Default Value**
Release phases of audio material.


**Bus Compressor**


This is the most transparent compressor, able to perform **Parameter** **Value Range** **Default Value**
substantial volume adjustments without artifacts.


**Compressor Opto**



The Opto Compressor is modeled after a vintage
compressor type using an optical circuit to control the
volume reduction of the input signal. These compressors are
usually associated with soft and unobtrusive attack and
release characteristics.


**Compressor VCA**


This compressor is more modern-sounding, with a slightly
more transparent sound. A VCA Compressor tends to have
quicker attack and release times than an Opto Compressor.

**Compressor Vintage**


This compressor has a sound similar to classic tube
compressors, with their gentle yet pumping response and a
dash of tube saturation.


**Mother Ducker Input**



**Parameter** **Value Range** **Default Value**



Add this effect as an insert to the track you want to use as a **Parameter Value Range** **Default Value**
trigger input, such as a kick drum track.

To Bus 1–8 Bus 1



**Mother Ducker**


Add this effect as an insert to the track you want to have the
ducking effect applied to. Use the meters to monitor the
level from your trigger input and tweak the Threshold and
Ratio parameters to adjust the amount of ducking. The
Attack and Release parameters can be used to sculpt the
envelope of the gain reduction to achieve exactly the
pumping effect you are after. Mother Ducker has eight
internal buses so you can set up multiple channel strips with
ducking effects from different sources.


**Transient Shaper**



**Parameter Value Range** **Default Value**



A transient shaper can be used to enhance or soften the **Parameter** **Value Range** **Default Value**
Attack and Release phases of audio material.

modulated by an LFO.

**AIR Amp Sim**



This effect simulates guitar and bass amplifiers with a
wide range of available cabinet models and tone shaping
options.


**AIR Diode Clip**


This is a distortion effect that can be used for anything
from adding subtle grit to drum breaks to aggressive
distorted mayhem.

**AIR Distortion**


This effect is a multi-type distortion that adds color to your **Parameter** **Value Range** **Default Value**
audio signal with varying types and amounts of distortion.

machines, and more to dramatically change the timbre of
your sound.

unique effects.

**AIR Tube Drive**


This effect is designed to reproduce the sound of an **Parameter** **Value Range** **Default Value**
overdriven tube amplifier.


**Decimator**



Decimator down-samples the incoming signal by removing
bits from the digital signal. The difference between
decimation and resampling is that Decimator does not use
any filtering to mask or correct digital artifacts. The result is
an effect ranging from mild to almost completely pure digital
distortion, depending on the setting and the source material.


**Distortion Amp**



**Parameter** **Value Range** **Default Value**



This effect is designed to reproduce the sound of a tube **Parameter** **Value Range** **Default Value**
amplifier at high volumes.



**Distortion Custom**


This effect is a highly customized distortion, capable of a **Parameter** **Value Range** **Default Value**
wide range of useable sounds.

**Distortion Fuzz**


This popular effect uses hard clipping of the audio signal,
which, at extreme settings, can turn a standard waveform
into a square wave, producing a “razor” effect.


**Distortion Grimey**



**Parameter** **Value Range** **Default Value**



This is a unique distortion effect that distorts a frequency **Parameter** **Value Range** **Default Value**
range in a selectable band.



**Distortion Overdrive**


This distortion is designed to sound like a mildly distorting
amplifier at medium volumes. It is the smoothest distortion
type available.


**Frequency Shifter**


A frequency shifter changes the frequencies of an input
signal by a fixed amount and alters the relationship of the
original harmonics. This can produce a chorus-like effect as
well as very crazy artificial timbres.

**Granulator**


This effect turns your incoming audio into small grains of
sound that can be looped, pitch shifted, and manipulated
in new and interesting ways.


**Resampler**


Resampler is similar to _**Decimator**_ in that it removes bits
from an incoming signal. The difference is that Resampler
applies a complex suite of filters and anti-aliasing to
attempt to retain the original sound quality. This is a
method used by popular vintage samplers and sampling
drum machines from the 1980s. Resampler can be used
to achieve a “dirty” sound on drum loops, without the
harshness of distortion.
