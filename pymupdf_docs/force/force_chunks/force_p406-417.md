Force now also includes Touch FX, a multi-effect plugin with ten different FX chain configurations, giving quick access to
beat-repeat, turntable, delay, filter, and modulation effects.


Use the controls on the left side of the Touch FX plugin window to adjust the settings for the **Touch Strip** control. You
can control the Touch Strip by assigning it to a MIDI control or by using the virtual touch strip on the touchscreen.


**Touch Strip:** This strip can be controlled manually by tapping and dragging from the touchscreen, or by assigning it
a MIDI control. Use this to control the selected Touch FX.


**Touch Enable:** Tap this box to enable touch control the currently selected Touch FX.


**Assigned Parameter:** Use this field to select a preset parameter to be controlled by the touch strip. This can be
separate from or in addition to controlling the **Wet/Dry** amount, depending on the **Touch > Wet/Dry** setting.


**Touch Value:** Use this slider to control the value of the **Assigned Parameter** controlled by the **touch strip** .


**Wet Amount:** Use this slider to set the blend the original signal (dry) and the effect signal (wet).


**Touch Value / Wet/Dry Lock:** Tap the **lock icon** to use the touch strip to control the **Wet/Dry** amount in addition to
the touch value of the **Assigned Parameter** .


**Touch Attack:** Use this slider to set the length of the attack phase of the envelope, which is triggered when you move
the touch strip control.


**Touch Release:** Use this slider to set length of the release phase of the envelope, which is triggered when you release
the touch strip control.


Use the controls on the right side of the Touch FX plugin window to select a Touch FX type and adjust its settings. You
can also select from the included presets at the top of the window.

frequency modulated by an LFO, which can be synced to
the project tempo.

slowing down of analog tape playback.







**Phaser**


The touch strip controls a phaser effect, created by multiple
ganged all-pass filters to create “notches,” or sharp spikes,
in the frequency spectrum. The frequencies of these all-pass
filters can be modulated by an LFO to create a sweeping
sound.


**Comb Filter**


The touch strip controls a comb filter, which creates
“notches” in the frequency spectrum, similar to the phaser,
by delaying the audio signal and adding it back to itself.

that emulates the sound created when running two analog
tape machines in parallel with a slight time misalignment.
