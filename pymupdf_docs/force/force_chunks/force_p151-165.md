The **Double-Speed Events** function **immediately** halves the lengths of all note events on the track in the arrangement
as well as the distance between them. In other words, the track’s notes are pressed closer together so the track sounds
like it is playing at twice the previous speed. This does not actually affect the pitches of notes or the tempo.


The **Half-Speed Events** function **immediately** doubles the lengths of all note events on the track in the arrangement as
well as the distance between them. In other words, the track’s notes are spread further apart so the track sounds like it
is playing at half of the previous speed. This does not actually affect the pitches of notes or the tempo.


The **Pitch Quantize** function forces the pitches of note events into a
specific scale.


**To select the desired root note of the scale**, use the **Root Note**
field.


**To select a type of scale**, use the **Scale** field.


**To determine which note events will be quantized**, tap the **Only**
**apply to selected events** checkbox.

When **on**, only the currently selected note events will be
quantized.

When **off**, **all** pitches in the current track will be quantized.


**To set lowest-possible and highest-possible pitches where the**
**quantized note events will be placed**, use the **Start Note** and **End**
**Note** fields (respectively). If a note event is originally outside of this
range, it will be forced to the nearest pitch (within the scale) inside
the range.


**To continue and quantize the note events**, tap **Do It** .


**To cancel**, tap **Close** .

The **Random Events** function creates random melodic or drum
patterns on the current MIDI track in the arrangement.


**To** **select the type of events you want to create**, use the **Event**
**Type** field to select **Drum Events** or **Melodic Events** .


**To** **select how the events will be created relative to the existing**
**events on the track**, use the **Replace** field:

**Replace All Events** : Select this option to replace all events on
the track with the randomly generated ones.

**Replace Events in Note Range** : Select this option to replace
all events in the designated note range on the track with the
randomly generated ones. Use the **Bank** or **Start Pad** and
**End Pad** menus to set the note range for drum events or the
**Start Note** and **End Note** menus to set the note range for
melodic events.

**Add to Existing Events** : Select this option to add the randomly
generated events to the track without replacing or overwriting
the existing ones.

**To** **set how many bars the events will use**, use the **Pattern Size**
( **Bars** ) field. The highest possible value is the number of bars in
the current sequence.


**To** **select the duration of the events**, use the **Note Length** field.
(This feature is nonfunctional if **Legato** is enabled while
generating melodic events.)


**To** **generate the events and keep this window open**, tap **Apply** .


**To** **generate the events and close the window**, tap **Do It** .


**To** **close the window without generating any events**, tap **Close** .

If **Event Type** is set to **Drum Events** :


**To** **select the pad bank that will be used to generate the**
**events**, use the **Bank** field or select **Range** to use the **Start**
**Pad** and **End Pad** menus to define a specific pad range
instead.


**To** **define a specific pad range over which the events will**
**be generated**, use the **Start Pad** or **End Pad** fields. You can
use these fields only if the **Bank** menu is set to **Range** .


**To** **set how closely together the events will be placed in the**
**track**, use the **Density** ( **%** ) slider.


**To** **set how widely or narrowly the rhythmic patterns of the**
**generated notes vary**, use the **Rhythm Variation** slider.


If **Event Type** is set to **Melodic Events** :


**To** **define a specific note range over which the events will**
**be generated**, use the **Start Note** or **End Note** fields.


**To enable or disable legato**, tap the **Legato** checkbox.

When **on**, the generated notes will be extended or
shortened to create a long, unbroken phrase from the first
note event’s start point to the last note event’s end point.
Each note event will sustain until another note event
starts. If multiple note events start at the same time (and
are not the last note events), their lengths will become
identical.

When **off**, the generated notes will use the duration set by
the **Note Length** menu.


**To** **set the maximum number of note events that can be**
**sounding simultaneously in the track**, use the **Polyphony**
field to select **1**      - **8** .


**To determine whether or not the notes will use a scale**, tap
the **Constrain Notes to Scale** checkbox.

When **on**, the notes will be within the scale determined by
the **Scale** menu.

When **off**, the notes will be chromatic.


**To** **set how closely together the events will be placed in the**
**track**, use the **Density** ( **%** ) slider.


**To** **set the root note of the scale that the notes will use**, use
the **Root Note** field.


**To** **select the scale or mode that the generated notes will**
**use**, use the **Scale** field.


The **Bounce to Sample** function **immediately** renders the track as an audio sample and places it in the project’s sample
pool. By default, it will be named **Bounce -** and appended with the track name. This function does not work for MIDI or
CV tracks.


The **Bounce to Audio Track** function **immediately** renders the track as an audio track in the project. By default, it will be
named **Audio** and appended with a number (e.g., **Audio 002** ). This function does not work for MIDI or CV tracks.

**Arrangement Track Editor**


When in Arrange Mode, events from the currently selected track can be edited using the bottom panel track editor.


**To open the track editor,** do either of the following:


    - Tap the arrow up icon at the bottom of the screen.


    - Double-tap inside a track lane in the main arrangement view.


Once opened, you can also adjust the height of the track editor by tapping and dragging the arrow icon or anywhere in
the editor toolbar.


For drum tracks, you can tap and hold on a pad header in the track editor to open a drop-down menu where you can
quickly **Mute**, **Solo**, or change the **Color** of the pad.


**To close the track editor,** tap the down arrow icon.


At the top of the Track Editor are two tabs, **Grid** and **Auto** . Use the **Grid** tab to edit MIDI events or audio regions. Use the
**Auto** tab to edit automation for the track. The editing workflow in the arrangement track editor is the same as in the _**Clip**_
_**Editor**_, except that the arrangement track editor is fixed to editing the arrangement event list, whereas the clip editor
follows the currently selected clip or arrangement event list.


**To edit a track from your arrangement using Clip Edit Mode,** make sure the arrangement is playing and the desired
track is selected (you can check this by making sure the **Back to Track** icon is not displayed on the selected track).
Then, open Clip Edit Mode to edit the arrangement track.


Press and hold **Shift** to view additional editing options for the Track Editor.


**To select all events,** tap **Select All** .


**To cut the selected events,** tap **Cut** .


**To copy the selected events,** tap **Copy** .


**To paste the selected events at the playhead location,** tap **Paste** .


**To delete the selected events,** tap **Delete** .


**To duplicate the selected events,** tap **Duplicate** . The events will be added after the last selected event.

**Locate Popup**


Force now includes a popup window for the Locate function, allowing you to quickly jump to specific points in your project.


**To open the Locate popup,** double-tap the **Bars:Beats:Ticks** field in the **toolbar** .


The Locate popup is divided into two sections:


The **Time** tab is used to adjust the position of the playhead in the arrangement, as well as adjust Loop and Record
settings.


**To move the playhead in the arrangement,** use the **Bars:Beats:Ticks** fields. You can also tap the **Step** and
**Bars** arrow buttons to move the playhead by the specified amount.


**To enable loop in the arrangement,** tap the **Loop** button. Use the **Loop Start** and **Loop End** fields to set the
length of the loop. Alternatively, you can set the loop length according to the Locator markers in the timeline.
When **Set Loop Range By Locator** is set to **On**, the loop range will automatically adjust to the length between
the selected Locator and the next Locator. The current loop region is always displayed in the timeline of the
arrangement whether it is activated or not.


**To enable automatic recording when the loop starts,** use the **Auto Record** field. When enabled, recording will
begin immediately when the arrangement loops.


The **Locators** tab is used to edit the six Locator markers which can be applied to the timeline.


**To add a locator,** tap **Set** .


**To rename a locator,** tap the **keyboard icon**, and then use the keyboard to enter a new name.


**To adjust the position of the locator,** use the **Bars:Beats:Ticks** fields.


**To edit the color of the locator,** tap the **eyedropper icon**, and then select a color from the list.


**To delete the locator,** tap the **X** icon.


**To close the Locate window,** tap **Close**, the **X** in the upper-right corner, or anywhere outside the window to return
to the arrangement.

**Saving and Exporting the Arrangement**


**To save and export your arrangement,** press the **Save** button, and then select **Audio Mixdown** . In this window, you
can mixdown or stem your arrangement into individual files.


**To set the time range that you want to mixdown,** use the **Start Bar** and **End Bar** fields under Audio Length. You
can add a number of seconds to the end of the mixdown to capture any ringing notes or effects (such as a reverb tail)
by adjusting the **Audio Tail** field.


**To set the parameters for the audio mixdown,** use the fields under **Render Source** and **Render Options** . Check
the **Separate Tracks** box to render each track of the arrangement as stems.


**To configure the audio mixdown file settings,** use the fields at the bottom of the screen to set the **File Format**, **Bit**
**Depth**, and **Sample Rate** .


You can also export the arrangement as a clip row in an ALS file to use with Ableton Live.


**To save the arrangement as a clip row,** press the **Save** button to bring up the Ableton Live Set Export popup, and
then select the **Export Arrange as Clips** option.

**Clip Event Editor**


The Clip Event Editor (formerly _Grid Mode_, or _Event View_ for MIDI tracks and _Region View_ for audio tracks)
lets you view and edit the note events or audio regions of each clip of a track in a project and their velocities.
This mode has three different appearances: one for audio tracks, one for drum tracks and one for keygroup
tracks, MIDI tracks, and plugin tracks.


**To enter the Clip Event Editor**, press **Menu** and then tap **Grid** . You can also tap **Grid** at the top of the screen in **Arrange**
**Mode**, **Clip Editor**, or **List Mode** .


For audio tracks, the waveform of the audio clip is shown.


For drum tracks, the left column shows you all available pads in a
vertical view with their corresponding events in the grid to the right.


For keygroup, plugin, MIDI and CV tracks, the left column shows a
vertical “piano roll” keyboard with the corresponding events in the grid
to the right.


156

---

## Page 157

In all views, the time counter at the top of the screen indicates the current playhead position.


Additionally, the **Settings** window lets you configure certain Clip Event
Editor settings.


**To view the Settings**, tap the **gear icon** .


Use the **Snap Mode** selector to set how events “snap” to the grid.


**Absolute** : Events will “snap” to the nearest time division on the grid
(as determined by the **TC** field or **Time Correct** window). This is
the typical and traditional method of using the snap/ quantization
feature.


**Relative** : Events will “snap” to the nearest time division on the grid
(as determined by the **TC** field or **Time Correct** window) **plus** the
original time position of the event (e.g., an event that is originally
three ticks past a time division on the grid will snap only to positions
that are three ticks past every time division).


Use the **Hitting Pad Selects All Events** selector to turn the feature on or off. When **On**, pressing a pad will automatically
select all note events for that pad in the selected clip on that track. When set to **Off**, pressing a pad will simply play its
sound without selecting any note events.


This setting is not available when using audio clips.


Use the **Auto-Scroll** selector to set how the screen behaves relative to the audio playhead.


**Follow** : The list will scroll along in the background while keeping the audio playhead centered.


**Page** : The list will move to the “next page” to follow the audio playhead.


**Off** : The list will not move at all.


These functions also apply to _**Arrange Mode**_ and the _**Clip Editor**_ .

**Audio Tracks**


When viewing audio clips in the Clip Event Editor, these seven tool icons at the top of the screen enable you to use
different functions in the clip.


Tap one to select its mode:


**Marquee** : Marquee Mode:


**To select a clip region**, tap the upper third of it.


**To move a clip region** (or multiple selected clip regions), tap and drag the upper third of it left or right.


**To split the clip at two specific points** (creating a clip region on either side and between them), tap and drag
across the middle third of it to create a translucent white box, and then tap the upper third of that box.


**To shorten or lengthen a clip region** (or multiple selected clip regions), tap and drag the lower third of it left
or right.


**Arrow** : Selection Mode:


**To select a clip region**, tap it.


**To move a clip region** (or multiple selected clip regions), tap and drag the upper third of it left or right.


**To shorten or lengthen a clip region** (or multiple selected clip regions), tap and drag the lower third of it left
or right.


**Pencil** : Draw Mode:


**To draw automation**, open the velocity/automation lane and tap and drag.


**Eraser** : Erase Mode:


**To erase a clip region** (or multiple selected clip regions), tap it.


**Scissors** : Split Mode:


**To split the clip at a specific point** (creating a clip region on either side), tap that point in the clip.


**To select a clip region**, tap its left-most edge.


**Mute** : Mute Mode:


**To mute or unmute a clip region** (or multiple selected clip regions), tap it.


**Magnifying Glass** : Navigation Mode:


**To move to another part of the clip**, tap and drag it.


**To zoom in or out**, spread or pinch your fingers (respectively) on the grid. You can do this vertically,
horizontally, or both at the same time.

## Page 159

Tap the **pencil Edit** icon to open the Grid Edit menu for audio clips:


Use **Trim Audio to Clip** to trim the audio sample to the size of the clip.


Use **Clear Regions** to clear the audio sample from the clip.


Use **Export as Audio** to save the current clip as an audio file.


Use the **Base File Name** field to name the resulting export based on the **Clip name** or **Track name** .


Check the **Include Track Volume/Pan Settings** box to include these settings in the export.


Check the **Bypass Track Effects Plugins** box to not include track effects plugins in the export.


Use the **Audio Tail** field to set the amount, in **seconds**, of extra time added to the end of the resulting audio files.


Use the **Bit Depth** field to set the bit depth to **8**, **16** or **24** .


Use the **Sample Rate** field to set the sample rate to **44.1**, **48**, **88.2** or **96 kHz** . In most cases, we recommend
selecting **44.1 kHz** .


Use **Flatten Clip** or **Flatten Elastique** to flatten the audio clip when transport playback is stopped, rendering all the
edits and regions within the clip bounds to a new audio clip in a single audio file. The Elastique Pro algorithm can be
used for time-stretching or pitch-shifting, providing higher-quality results with less artifacts than Force's standard
algorithm.


Regardless of which tool is selected, you can do any of the following to edit the selected audio clip regions.


**Tip** : If you want to hear only the audio track while editing, press the **Solo** button and press the relevant **Track Assign**
button to solo it.


**To select a clip region**, tap the arrow icon to enter Selection Mode and tap a clip region. When a clip region is
selected, all region parameters will be available to edit.


**To undo your last action**, press **Undo** .


**To redo the last action you undid**, press **Shift** + **Undo** / **Redo** .


**To move the selected clip region**, tap **Nudge** at the bottom of the screen, and then use the **data dial o** r **–** / **+** buttons
to shift the clip region left or right. Alternatively, if the **arrow tool** or **marquee tool** are selected, tap and drag the
upper third of the selected clip region left or right. By default, you can move a clip region only by quantization values
defined by the **Time Correct** value (see _**General Features**_ _>_ _**Timing Correct**_ _(_ _**TC**_ _)_ to learn about this).


**To move the selected clip region without restricting** (“snapping”) **it to the quantization grid**, tap and hold **Don’t**
**Snap** in the lower-left corner of the screen, and then use the **data dial o** r **–** / **+** buttons to shift the clip region. In this
case, each nudge is equivalent to four ticks.


**To adjust the start point or end point of the selected clip region** (without changing its position), tap **Edit Start** at
the bottom of the screen, and then use the **data dial o** r **–** / **+** buttons.


**To split the clip at the current playhead position** (creating a clip region on either side), tap **Split** at the bottom of
the screen.


**To copy, cut, or paste the selected clip region**, press **Copy** or
press and hold **Shift**, and then tap **Copy** or **Cut** . Turn the **data dial**
to move the highlighted clip region, and then press the **data dial** to
paste it at its current location. Alternatively, press and hold **Shift**,
and then tap **Paste** (respectively).


**To duplicate the selected clip region**, tap **Duplicate** at the
bottom of the screen. The duplicate clip region will appear
immediately after the original one.


**To create a fade-in or fade out for the selected clip region**, use the **Fade In** or **Fade Out** fields, respectively. The
fades will be shown as a sloped line at the start or end of the clip region.


**To set the level of the selected clip region**, use the **Level** field. The waveform amplitude will change accordingly.

**To reverse the selected clip region**, tap **Reverse** .


**To mute the selected clip region**, tap **Mute** .


**To lengthen or shorten the selected clip region without changing its pitch**, tap **Warp**, which will enable the **Semi**,
**Fine**, and **BPM** fields next to it. Use the **BPM** field to change the tempo, which will change the length of the clip region
accordingly. Use the **Semi** and **Fine** fields if you want to change the pitch (this is useful for matching the durations of
two samples with different pitches).


**Tip** : You can configure audio track recording to ensure the resulting clip region is warped automatically. You can then
adjust the project tempo while clip region remains in time. See _**Menu**_ _>_ _**Preferences**_ _>_ _**General**_ to learn about this.


**Note** : When you record an audio file, the current project tempo will be embedded with it. This information is stored
within the sample file when you save the project. When you warp an audio clip region, the warping algorithm uses this
project tempo and the current value in the BPM field to generate the “stretch factor.”


**Note** : The Warp algorithms are very CPU-intensive and can result in audio drop-outs during playback if used too
freely. Be mindful of how (and how often) you use the warp function. You can reduce the CPU resources required by
doing any/all of the following:


- Minimize the amount of pitch adjustment (e.g., the **Semi** and **Fine** fields).


- Avoid warping very small clip regions.


- Warp as few tracks or clip regions as possible (i.e., reduce the number of total number of voices [of the polyphonic
limit] that use the warp algorithm at a given time), especially instances where the warped regions start at the same
time.


- If you have warped samples used in a drum kit, consider using **the Flatten Pad** function to consolidate the
affected pad’s layers into one audio sample (see _**here**_ to learn about this). After you flatten the pad, its
sample/samples no longer need to be warped.


**To open the Timing Correct window**, press and hold **Shift**, and then tap **TC** at the bottom of the screen. See _**General**_
_**Features**_ _>_ _**Timing Correct**_ _(_ _**TC**_ _)_ to learn about this.


**To mute or solo the clip**, press and hold **Shift**, and then tap **Mute** or **Solo** (respectively) at the bottom of the screen.

previous speed. This does not actually affect the pitches of notes or the tempo.


The **Half-Speed Events** function **immediately** doubles the lengths of all note events in the clip as well as the distance
between them. In other words, all notes are spread further apart so the clip sounds like it is playing at half of the previous
speed. This does not actually affect the pitches of notes or the tempo.


The **Pitch Quantize** function forces the pitches of note events into a
specific scale.


**To select the desired root note of the scale**, use the **Root Note**
field.


**To select a type of scale**, use the **Scale** field.


**To determine which note events will be quantized**, tap the **Only**
**apply to selected events** checkbox.


When **on**, only the currently selected note events will be
quantized.


When **off**, **all** pitches in the current clip will be quantized.


**To set lowest-possible and highest-possible pitches where the**
**quantized note events will be placed**, use the **Start Note** and **End**
**Note** fields (respectively). If a note event is originally outside of this
range, it will be forced to the nearest pitch (within the scale) inside
the range.
