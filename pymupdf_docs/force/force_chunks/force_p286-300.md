**MIDI Learn**


You can use the MIDI Learn function to assign external MIDI controllers to various parameters in your specific Force
project:


 - Mixer parameters such as volume, pan, mute, and solo for tracks, returns, submixes, and main outputs.


 - Pad parameters (for drum tracks and clip tracks only) such as tuning, filter and amp envelopes, layer settings, LFO
settings, and velocity.


 - Track parameters, which depend on the track type.


 - Insert effects parameters, which depend on the effect type.

These assignments will be saved with your Force project.

**To enter MIDI Learn Mode**, press **Menu**, and then tap **MIDI Learn** .


Each assignment has the following settings:

**Source** : This is the name or number of the track, return, submix, or main output.

**Target** : This is the name of the assigned command or parameter.

**Type** : This is the type of message:


    - **Toggle Button** : When the control is a button, pressing it will activate or deactivate its command or parameter.
It will remain in that state until you press it again.


    - **Momentary Button** : When the control is a button, pressing and holding it down will activate its command or
parameter. Releasing the button will deactivate it.


    - **Fixed Button** : When the control is a button, pressing it will send its command.


    - **Note** : When the control is a button, pressing it will send the MIDI note (determined by the **Data** field).


    - **Abs CC** : When the control is a knob, turning it will send its CC message (determined by the **Data** field)
according to the precise physical position of the knob. (When you start turning it, the value may “jump” from
its current value to the one corresponding to the knob’s position.) This is for use with knobs that have a
maximum and minimum position.


    - **Rel CC Offset** : When the control is a knob, turning it will send the CC message (determined by the **Data** field),
starting from the current value. This is for use with 360° knobs controlling parameters that have a maximum
and minimum position.


    - **Rel CC 2’s Complement** : When the control is a knob, turning it will send the CC message (determined by the
**Data** field), starting from the current value. This is for use with 360° knobs controlling bipolar parameters
where there is a center (12:00) position (e.g., panning).

**Type** is automatically detected based on the **Source** and **Target** fields, though you can use this field to assign it
manually if it does not detect it properly.

**Ch** : This is the MIDI channel the control is using.

**Data** : This is the MIDI note number or CC number.

**Flip** : Tap this box to select or deselect it. When selected, the control’s polarity will be reversed (e.g., a button’s “off”
state will become its “on” state and vice versa).
