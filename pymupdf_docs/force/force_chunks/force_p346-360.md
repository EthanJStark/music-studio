**Updates in Force 3.0.5**

**New Features**


**Arrange Mode**


Force now includes Arrange Mode, a fully featured linear sequencer. With Arrange Mode, you can:


  - Create an arrangement of a song against a linear timeline.


  - Record your clip performance or live input (MIDI or Audio) into a linear timeline.


  - Edit and arrange your song using Force's powerful Arrange Edit commands.


  - Mixdown your song to a stereo audio file, or stem it as separate tracks.


  - Experiment with different song ideas by launching clips against your linear arrangement.


  - Edit a single track from your arrangement in the Arrange Mode pull-up track editor, Grid or List editors.


**Getting Started**


**To enter Arrange Mode,** press **Menu** and then tap **Arrange** . The event editor's Arrange, Grid, Clip and List views are
displayed as tabs in the top left of the screen to make it easy to jump between them.


The toolbar at the top of Arrange Mode lets you switch between the different edit modes as well as showing project and
timing information.


Use the **Arrange**, **Grid**, **Clip** and **List** icons to switch between the different Force modes.


Tap the **automation icon** to toggle between **Read** and **Write** . To disable or enable global automation entirely, press
and hold **Shift** and tap this icon.


Use the **BPM** field to adjust the tempo of the project.


Use the **Bars** field to set the length of the arrangement.


The time counter at the top of the screen indicates the current playhead position. Double-tap this field to open the
_**Locate Popup**_ .


Tap the **pencil** icon to open the _**Arrange Edit**_ window.


Tap the **gear icon** to open the _**Grid Settings**_ .


348

## Page 349

The project's tracks are displayed in Arrange Mode on a linear timeline. Each track header will show Record Arm, Track
Automation and Crossfader Assign states. Note that this requires the vertical zoom to be adjusted so there is enough
space to show all components. Use the pinch and expand gestures to change the zoom level of the arrangement.


**To open the Timing Correct window**, tap **TC** at the bottom of the screen. Alternatively, tap the timing correct value
shown above the track headers. See _**General Features**_ _>_ _**Timing Correct (TC)**_ to learn about this.


**To enable or disable MIDI record erasing in Arrange Mode,** tap the **MIDI Rec Erase** button at the bottom of the screen.
When enabled, the new recording will replace existing MIDI data in the arrangement. When disabled, recording MIDI will
overdub on existing MIDI data in the track arrangement.


**To enable or disable loop,** tap **Loop** at the bottom of the screen.


**To return playback of all tracks to the recorded arrangement,** tap the **Back to Arrange** button.


The Arrangement timeline also features six user-controllable Locate markers. Press and hold **Shift** to show the six Locator
buttons at the bottom of the screen.


**To add a locator at the playhead position,** tap one of the six Locator buttons. You can also use the _**Locate Popup**_
to edit these markers.

**To record a clip performance into Force's arrangement timeline:**


1. You must first configure the **Record** button to point to the linear
arrangement rather than the clip matrix. You can set this by
doing either of the following:


      - Hold **Shift** and press the **REC** button.


      - Press and hold the **REC** button to open the Start
Recording Selector window, and then tap **To**
**Arrangement** .


2. Next, enter Arrange mode by pressing **Menu** and tapping **Arrange** .


3. Trigger a clip or scene to begin recording. As clips are triggered, Arrange Mode will draw regions containing audio
or MIDI data into the track lanes.


**To replace a section of the arrangement with a new clip performance:**


1. Tap the **Loop** button at the bottom of the screen to activate loop.


2. Set the **Loop Start** and **Loop End** points by tapping and dragging the beginning and end of the loop region in the
timeline. Tapping and dragging in the middle of the loop region moves both the Loop Start and Loop End points
at the same time.


3. Enable arrangement recording by following the directions above.


4. Trigger a clip or scene to begin recording. The recording will begin at the Loop Start point and finishes at the Loop
End point, making it easy to replace a section of the arrangement.


**To play the arrangement:**


  - Press **Play** to begin playback of the arrangement from 1:1:00, or if **Loop** is activated, from the Loop Start.


  - Hold **Shift** and press **Play** to begin playback from the current playhead position.


To move the playhead position, tap the **Playhead Position** field in the toolbar to select it, and then use the **data dial** or
**-/+** buttons to adjust the value. Alternatively, you can set the playhead position by tapping in the lower-half of the timeline.


**Switching Between the Arrangement and Clips**


For each track in Force, you can play a clip or play the linear arrangement, but never both at the same time. When you
trigger a clip, the arrangement on that track will stop playing; conversely, if you are triggering clips and then play the
arrangement, the clips will stop.


In Arrange Mode, a track will show the **Back to Track** icon (a square with a play symbol shown on the right side of the
track lane) when either there is a clip playing or the **Stop All** button has been pressed.


**To return playback of a track to its linear arrangement,** simply tap the **Back to Track** icon.


**To return** _**all**_ **tracks to the linear arrangement,** tap the **Back to Arrange** button at the bottom of the screen in
Arrange Mode.


You can also set the track's playback type from Matrix mode or Force's launch pad mode. Hold **Shift** and press the
**Launch** button to open the **Launch Config** window. Select the **Show arrangement in clip matrix** option so it is enabled.
The arrangement row will appear as the top row of pads above the first row of clips in Matrix/Launch mode. Tapping a
pad in the arrangement row will stop playing any clips on the respective track and play the linear arrangement. Tapping
the **Scene Launch** button for the arrangement row will play the linear arrangement for all tracks.

The **Double-Speed Events** function **immediately** halves the lengths of all note events on the track in the arrangement
as well as the distance between them. In other words, the track’s notes are pressed closer together so the track sounds
like it is playing at twice the previous speed. This does not actually affect the pitches of notes or the tempo.


The **Half-Speed Events** function **immediately** doubles the lengths of all note events on the track in the arrangement as
well as the distance between them. In other words, the track’s notes are spread further apart so the track sounds like it
is playing at half of the previous speed. This does not actually affect the pitches of notes or the tempo.


The **Pitch Quantize** function forces the pitches of note events into a
specific scale.


**To select the desired root note of the scale**, use the **Root Note**
field.


**To select a type of scale**, use the **Scale** field.

quantized.

When **off**, **all** pitches in the current track will be quantized.


**To set lowest-possible and highest-possible pitches where the**
**quantized note events will be placed**, use the **Start Note** and **End**
**Note** fields (respectively). If a note event is originally outside of this
range, it will be forced to the nearest pitch (within the scale) inside
the range.


**To continue and quantize the note events**, tap **Do It** .


**To cancel**, tap **Close** .

The **Random Events** function creates random melodic or drum
patterns on the current MIDI track in the arrangement.

**Type** field to select **Drum Events** or **Melodic Events** .


**To** **select how the events will be created relative to the existing**
**events on the track**, use the **Replace** field:

**Replace All Events** : Select this option to replace all events on
the track with the randomly generated ones.

**Replace Events in Note Range** : Select this option to replace
all events in the designated note range on the track with the
randomly generated ones. Use the **Bank** or **Start Pad** and
**End Pad** menus to set the note range for drum events or the
**Start Note** and **End Note** menus to set the note range for
melodic events.

**Add to Existing Events** : Select this option to add the randomly
generated events to the track without replacing or overwriting
the existing ones.

**To** **set how many bars the events will use**, use the **Pattern Size**
( **Bars** ) field. The highest possible value is the number of bars in
the current sequence.


**To** **select the duration of the events**, use the **Note Length** field.
(This feature is nonfunctional if **Legato** is enabled while
generating melodic events.)

**To** **select the pad bank that will be used to generate the**
**events**, use the **Bank** field or select **Range** to use the **Start**
**Pad** and **End Pad** menus to define a specific pad range
instead.


**To** **define a specific pad range over which the events will**
**be generated**, use the **Start Pad** or **End Pad** fields. You can
use these fields only if the **Bank** menu is set to **Range** .


**To** **set how closely together the events will be placed in the**
**track**, use the **Density** ( **%** ) slider.


**To** **set how widely or narrowly the rhythmic patterns of the**
**generated notes vary**, use the **Rhythm Variation** slider.


If **Event Type** is set to **Melodic Events** :


**To** **define a specific note range over which the events will**
**be generated**, use the **Start Note** or **End Note** fields.


**To enable or disable legato**, tap the **Legato** checkbox.

When **on**, the generated notes will be extended or
shortened to create a long, unbroken phrase from the first
note event’s start point to the last note event’s end point.
Each note event will sustain until another note event
starts. If multiple note events start at the same time (and
are not the last note events), their lengths will become
identical.

When **off**, the generated notes will use the duration set by
the **Note Length** menu.


**To** **set the maximum number of note events that can be**
**sounding simultaneously in the track**, use the **Polyphony**
field to select **1**      - **8** .


**To determine whether or not the notes will use a scale**, tap
the **Constrain Notes to Scale** checkbox.

When **on**, the notes will be within the scale determined by
the **Scale** menu.

When **off**, the notes will be chromatic.


**To** **set how closely together the events will be placed in the**
**track**, use the **Density** ( **%** ) slider.


**To** **set the root note of the scale that the notes will use**, use
the **Root Note** field.


**To** **select the scale or mode that the generated notes will**
**use**, use the **Scale** field.


The **Bounce to Sample** function **immediately** renders the track as an audio sample and places it in the project’s sample
pool. By default, it will be named **Bounce -** and appended with the track name. This function does not work for MIDI or
CV tracks.


The **Bounce to Audio Track** function **immediately** renders the track as an audio track in the project. By default, it will be
named **Audio** and appended with a number (e.g., **Audio 002** ). This function does not work for MIDI or CV tracks.
