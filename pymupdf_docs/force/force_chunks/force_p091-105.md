**Effects**


You can apply various effects to the pads, keygroups, tracks, main outputs and submixes, using **insert** and **send** / **return**
effects. This chapter can help you get a good overall understanding of how the effects work.


See _**Appendix**_ _>_ _**Effects & Parameters**_ for a list of all available effects (with a brief description of each) and their editable
parameters.


**Overview**


In a track, each **pad** or **keygroup** can have up to **four insert effects** applied to it. See _**Insert Effects**_ _>_ _**Pads**_ or _**Keygroups**_
to learn more about this.


An entire **track** can also have up to **four insert effects** applied to it, as well. See _**Insert Effects**_ _>_ _**Tracks**_ to learn more
about this.


Additionally, each **pad**, **keygroup**, and **track** can each be sent to (up to) **four return channels**, each of which can have
up to **four insert effects** of their own. Their audio will be routed through the insert effects on those returns, and the
processed audio will be sent to a main output. See _**Send**_ _/_ _**Return Effects**_ to learn more about this.


Finally, you can apply up to **four insert effects** to each main output (a stereo pair of channels: **Outputs 1** / **2** or **Outputs**
**3** / **4** ) and submix. See _**Insert Effects**_ _>_ _**Main Outputs**_ or _**Submixes**_ to learn more about this.


There are three other modes that handle effects differently:


  - The **Sampler** can use up to **four insert effects**, which are applied to the audio as you record it. This means that
the effects cannot be “removed” from the sound later. Learn more about the Sampler in the _**Modes**_ _>_ _**Sampler**_
chapter.


  - Similarly, the **Looper** can use up to **four insert effects**, which are applied to the audio as you record it. This
means that the effects cannot be “removed” from the sound later. Learn more about the Looper in the _**Modes**_ _>_
_**Looper**_ chapter.


  - In **XYFX Mode**, the effects act like a single insert effect on that track. In fact, **XYFX** is the name of the insert effect
you have to load to the track before you can use this mode. Learn more about XYFX Mode in the _**Modes**_ _>_ _**XYFX**_
_**Mode**_ chapter.

**Send** / **Return Effects**


Send/return effects work in the following way:

1. A **pad** or **drum**, **keygroup**, **plugin** or **audio** **track** sends its audio to a **return** at a designated **send level** .

2. That audio is processed by the effects on the return. Each return can have up to **four insert effects** loaded and
activated.

3. The processed audio is sent to a pair of main outputs (stereo) or a single main output (mono).

You can load send/return effects and set return levels only in the Track Mixer, described below. The rest of this section
describes the different ways to set the desired send levels for pads or tracks.
