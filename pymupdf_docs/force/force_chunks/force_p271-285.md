**Crossfader**


In the Crossfader tab, you can learn any automation parameter from within your project to Force's Crossfader.


**To enter Crossfader mode,** do either of the following:


  - In Macros Mode, tap the **Crossfader** button at the bottom of the screen.


  - Press and hold **Edit** and then press **Assign A** or **Assign B** .


There are 16 available crossfader scenes, which can be selected using the **Mode** field at the top left of the screen. Each
scene can be assigned to one or more parameters.


**To change crossfader scenes directly from the hardware,** press and hold **Assign A** and then press **Assign B** to
move to the next scene. To move to the previous scene, press and hold **Assign B** and then press **Assign A** .


**To learn a parameter to the crossfader:**

Keygroup, Insert, Return, Submix or Main Output parameters, can be selected as part of a macro control.


3. Hold down either the **Assign A** or **Assign B** buttons on Force, and then move any parameter on the touchscreen.
When holding **Assign A**, the parameter will be assigned to the crossfader with the minimum value to the left side and
the maximum value to the right side. When holding **Assign B**, the parameter will be reversed with the maximum value
on the left side and the minimum value on the right side.


**To edit the crossfader assignment,** press and hold **Edit** and then press **Assign A** or **Assign B** . This will take you to the

**Pad Grid**


In the **Pad Grid** tab, you can learn any automation parameter from within your project to Force's pad matrix. Assigning
automation parameters to the pads gives you a more performative way of controlling effects and mixer parameters. For
example, you can assign a pad to mute a group of tracks, or to toggle insert effects on and off.


Use the **Mode** field at the top left of the touchscreen to select the pad **Bank** to assign parameters to.


Use the **Full Screen** button to make the current pad **Bank** fill the entire screen.


**To access the Pad Grid macros directly from the hardware, do any of the following:**


  - Press and hold the **Knobs** button, and then press the **Launch/Config** button to split the pad matrix between
launching clips and triggering the Pad Grid macros.


  - Press and hold the **Knobs** button, and then press the **Notes/Config** button to split the pad matrix between playing
notes and triggering the Pad Grid macros.


  - Press and hold the **Knobs** button, and then press the **Launch/Config** and **Notes/Config** buttons at the same
time to split the pad matrix between launching clips in the top quadrants and playing notes and triggering the Pad
Grid macros in the bottom quadrants.


When the Pad Grid macros are active in the pad matrix, you can use the **Edit** buttons to edit, copy and delete macros
from these controls directly from the hardware.


**To learn a parameter to the pad grid,** follow the directions _**above**_ .

**Env Follower**


In the **Env Follower** tab, you can use an audio signal (such as a kick drum) as a control signal to create side-chain or
modulation effects.


There are 16 available envelope followers, which can be selected using the **Mode** field at the top left of the touchscreen.


Tap the **On** button next to the Mode field to enable or disable the envelope.


Use the **Envelope Source** field to select the audio signal that will be used as the control signal for the envelope. This can
be audio from a track, or, if you choose a Drum track, audio from a specific pad. You can also select the **Returns**,
**Submixes**, and **Main Output** tracks, as well as dedicated **LFO** (low frequency oscillator) shapes.


After selecting the Envelope Source, you can use the additional fields on the left side of the touchscreen to configure the
envelope parameters. The available parameters when a track, pad or keygroup is selected as the Envelope Source are as
follows:


Use the selector below the Envelope Source field to set where the envelope is applied:


    - **Input:** The envelope is applied at the audio input source. This option is not available for individual Pads or
Keygroups.


    - **Pre-Inserts:** The envelope is applied before any insert effects.


    - **Post-Fader:** The envelope is applied at the end of the channel strip after any insert effects and after the set
volume level.


    - **Playback:** The envelope is applied on playback of the selected track. This option is only available for MIDI
and CV tracks.


Use the knobs below the envelope selector to adjust the parameters of the envelope. Tap the arrows to move between
the pages of parameters when applicable.


    - **Gain (%)** adjust the amount of gain applied to the envelope.


    - **Delay (ms)** adjusts the amount of delay in milliseconds after which the envelope is triggered.


    - **Gate (%)** adjusts the amount of gate applied to the envelope


    - **Hyst (%)** adjusts the level at which the gate closes after opening.


    - **Attack** adjusts the amount of attack for the envelope gate. This can also be adjusted by tapping and dragging
the **A** handle in the envelope display.


    - **Decay** adjusts the amount of decay for the envelope gate. This can also be adjusted by tapping and dragging
the **D** handle in the envelope display.

When **LFO** is selected as the Envelope Source, the available parameters are as follows:


Use the selector to configure how the LFO is applied to the envelope. Select **Free-Running** for the LFO to continue
even when not triggered, or select **Reset On Play** for the LFO to revert to its starting configuration when triggered.


Use the knobs below the selector to adjust the parameters of the LFO:


    - **Freq (Hz)** adjusts the frequency, in Hertz, of the LFO.


    - **Phase (º)** adjust the starting phase of the LFO.


    - **Level (%)** adjusts the amount of LFO applied.


When the LFO envelope is engaged, you will see a representation of the LFO signal.


Once you have configured the envelope follower source, use the right side of the screen to select the parameter(s) that it
will modulate using the same directions as _**above**_ .
