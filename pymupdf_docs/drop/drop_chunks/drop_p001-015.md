## **Power**

Power Drop using the _included power supply_ or via the _USB1 port_ . The benefit of using the included 12V power supply is that you still have both

USB-C ports available to connect other gear. It is also the best choice to suppress audible noise caused by ground loops.


_Power input: 12V DC, 1200 mA min_ _what Drop requires when powered via external power supply_
_USB1 input:_ _5V DC,  1500 mA min_ _what Drop requires when powered via USB1_
_USB1 output: 5V DC,  1500 mA max_ _when Drop is used as USB host to power other gear via USB (automatic host role detection)_
_USB2 output: 5V DC,  500 mA max     when Drop is used as USB host to power other gear via USB (automatic host role detection)_


If you are using USB-C, you must use the USB1 port with the little flash symbol next to it. You also need a USB-C-to-C connection and your USB host

must be able to supply at least 1500mA. Computer USB-C ports usually can supply twice as much current.


_Only USB-C to USB-C cables in conjunction with a USB-C host or power supply can be used to power Drop. USB-A cables and USB-A power_
_supplies will NOT work for power, even if the power supply meets the electrical requirements. The USB-A socket does not allow the necessary_
_power negotiation between Drop and power supply._

## **Connectivity**

Drop can control up to eight other MIDI devices with

its user interface. Drop features 2x USB and 4x TRS

MIDI ports, so that each device benefits from _its own_

_connection_, providing full data bandwidth and its own

clock signal with individual micro-delay.


**In this example...**


The laptop ( _DAW_ only offers USB connections, so it is)

obvious to connect it via USB. The laptop may also

power Drop via its USB1 port.


The _SEQUENCER_ may send a lot of MIDI data, so it

may be a good choice to connect it via USB. Also,

Drop can eventually power the sequencer via USB.


_Incoming MIDI_, e.g. from KEYBOARD, GROOVEBOX,

DAW, SEQUENCER, SYNTH A, can be distributed to

other devices using Drop s ’ _Device Merger_ function.


Drop s MIDI ’ _In and Out ports are not related_ to each

other and can be used for different devices, like

KEYBOARD and SYNTH D in this example.


It is still possible to connect devices in classic daisy
chain cabling, using MIDI Thru, like SYNTH A and B.


Drop s two ’ _CV inputs and outputs_ are mostly used for

clock and timing. The outputs can also be variable 0
5V control voltages 12-bit DAC .( )

#### **USB, TRS, CV pros and cons**

USB-MIDI: High data rate, not so precise with MIDI clock timing. Requires class-compliant MIDI gear if Drop is used as USB host.
TRS-MIDI: Low data rate, but mostly sufficient, especially when each device has its own cable carrying only the device s data. Precise clock timing.’
CV: On Drop, same clock timing precision as TRS-MIDI.

#### **2x USB-C**

**USB MIDI**


Connect laptops or class-compliant MIDI devices to Drop. With USB, there is always host and device role to be negotiated. Drop will automatically

detect which mode is necessary and can also act as a MIDI host for other controllers and instruments. In MENU > Settings, you can switch the mode

for each port from Host + Device auto-detection to Device Only . As a MIDI host, Drop can supply 5V on each port to power the connected “ ” “ ”

device. USB1 can supply up to 1500mA and USB2 up to 500mA. The specs are also printed on Drop s bottom side. You can also use the included ’

USB-C to USB-A adaptor if your device requires an oldschool USB-A/B cable.


_USB-hubs are not supported, so you can only connect one USB device per port._


To connect to MIDI devices via USB, your device must be class-compliant. This means, that no driver needs to be installed to use it, which applies to
most gear out on the market. However, some manufacturers e.g. Roland still require a driver for their USB-MIDI gear. To use their devices with ( )
Drop, you need to use the classic MIDI TRS/DIN connection. Drop will show you a popup message if the USB gear connected is not class-compliant.

**USB keyboard**


Connect a USB computer keyboard for navigation and to name devices, controls and

snapshots.


In Menu > Settings, select the approriate layout e.g. ( QWERTY, QWERTZ, AZERTY .)


Navigation = Arrow keys, Escape, Enter, Backspace.
Change slot = Shift + Arrow keys
CTRL+9 = MENU button
CTRL+0 = PLAY button
CTRL+1-8 = Buttons around the display, clockwise

#### **4x MIDI TRS In, 4x MIDI TRS Out**

Use these ports to connect any MIDI equipment to Drop. Four ports enable you to connect one device per port in a star-topology instead of daisy

chaining the MIDI signal from device to device. The star-topology enables high data throughput and individual MIDI clock delays per device.


_Use the small switches on the back to select TRS type A or B for Drop s MIDI output. If you pick the wrong mode, your device may not receive ’_
_MIDI data from Drop._

#### **2x CV out**

Drop s CV inputs and outputs support a voltage range between 0,0 and 5,0 Volts. ’


The outputs can be used independently to send different kinds of clock signals, triggers and gates to sync analogue gear. They can also be used as a

simple continuous voltage outputs that can be assigned to any of Drop s controls. The resolution is 12 bits 4096 steps .’ ( )

#### **2x CV in**

Use CV inputs 1 and 2 to connect Drop to an external analogue clock source. CV1 expects the clock signal 16( th or 8th notes and CV2 can be )

configured to receive a dedicated start and stop trigger or gate signal.


There is also another mode available that lets you use the CV1 and 2 inputs to fire snapshots from external modular gear, where CV In 1 receives

triggers and CV In 2 receives a control voltage to select a snapshot. You can enable this mode in the _CV Config_ menu.


If you are planning to control your modular rack with Drop, we recommend to use a dedicated MIDI-to-CV-out converter module.

## **Step-by-step workflow**

**1 Decide which gear to use)**


Before getting into Drop, you should have an idea of what kind of setup you want to build and what gear you want to connect to Drop. Ideally, you

already have your grooveboxes or synths play a loop, and now it is time to create an accessible user interface for them on Drop.


**2 Init your project)**


Select _Project > Clean Init_ . You now have an empty project that does absolutely nothing the perfect starting point for a – _setup with hardware gear_,

where mapping is all done in Drop.

For a DAW-only setup, _Project > DAW Init_ is a one-click init option that applies a default mapping to Drop, so that every control element sends out a

default CC message over USB1. From there, you can map everything in your DAW. You can skip steps 3 and 4.


**3 Create and configure devices)**


Go to the _Devices_ menu and add the devices you want to use in your live set up to 8 devices max . Even if your device uses multiple MIDI channels, ( )

you only need to list it as one device in Drop. Also hook up keyboards and sequencers that merge their data with Drop s data and send it out to ’

other connected gear. You should also configure clocks in this step.


**4 Mapping on Drop)**


Each of Drop s controls can send out up to 8 different MIDI messages with different curves which allows flexible macro mapping. Each control offers ’

8 Slots to set up different kind of MIDI messages. This is an essential and powerful feature to create a user interface that speaks across multiple

devices in your setup.


Use the _Mapping_ menu to configure the controls you want to use. Depending on your target device, you can either enter the MIDI parameters by

hand, use MIDI Learn, or use the included MIDI CC and NRPN database if it contains your target device.


**5 Snapshots)**


By now, you should have developed a feeling for your newly created user interface. It is time to create some snapshots! These can either be fallback

safety net points, peak moments, snapshots that only affect a subset of controls so you can combine them later, a fixed chain of snapshots that

follow your song s arrangement, or you simply skip snapshots and use them spontaneously on stage as save-and-recall points. ’

## **PLAY view**

#### **Beatjump**

This view controls and shows the playback position

inside the current cycle. Use the eight buttons around

the display to jump to another playback position while

playing.



**MIDI traffic monitor**

_Note: Performing a beatjump also sends a Song Position message to all devices, that have the according_

_check mark set in the clock menu._



dark green = only clock and system data
green = data
light grey = no traffic
red = data overflow, lose packets
dark grey = nothing connected
blue = USB keyboard connected
Flash symbol = USB port serves as host, delivers
5V power to the connected device.



Change the playback position
Push the eight cycle buttons to change the playback
position. This is useful for example, if you have
scheduled a Drop, and need to shorten or extend the
time until it fires.



Cycle end = Drop time
The 12 o clock position marks the start and end of a cycle. It also marks ’
the time when a snapshot in Drop mode is executed.



Current playback position

#### **Cycle length**

The cycle length can be set from 1 to 32 bars.


Drop is not a sequencer itself, but you can connect other sequencers or

grooveboxes with their internal sequencers to Drop. These other devices

can run their own sequencers with their own time signature. Drop on the

other hand simply keeps a global time measure.


Internally, Drop uses 16 sixteenth notes per bar. But this only plays a role

for clock signals.

#### **Quantization**

Select between 1 bar and

1/4th note quantization

when pushing the cycle

buttons to change the

playback position.

#### **Monitor**

The MIDI monitor helps to see and debug what is going on between Drop and a connected MIDI device.


  - Verify, that Drop sends out the data your device expects.


  - Verify, that the connected device sends data back.


  - Check if a device sends unnecessary data that can be filtered out in the MIDI merge filter.

## **MENU view**

#### **Devices**

Setting up devices is the first step you should do when creating a new live set. In this menu, up to 8 MIDI

devices can be configured that Drop can interact with at the same time.


Decide, to which port you want to connect your device and if it needs MIDI output, input, or both.


_You can verify proper communication using the MIDI Monitor in the PLAY view._


**ON** Activate or deactivate the device and the control elements linked to it.


**Name** Enter the name of your device, for convenience during the mapping process.


**Default Channel** The default MIDI channel number. Each control that maps to this device can either send to the

default channel or a specific channel 1-16. If your device only uses one channel, use the default channel in the

mapping. That way, if you want to switch the channel at a later point, you only have to change it in the device

menu instead of changing it in each control.


_If you connect a device that uses multiple channels, you should still set up only one device for it._


You can select each control element s channel in that element s mapping specifically. The channel you’ ’

set in the device is just a default value.
