#### **MIDI CC & NRPN database**

Drop ships with an open-source MIDI database* on board, which contains the MIDI mapping tables of many popular devices.


First, go to _MENU > Devices > Database_ and scroll through the list to see if your hardware device is included. If you found it, select the file to assign

it to the device.


Then, enter _MENU > Mapping_, turn, push, move the control element to map and scroll to the Slot page. Now, when you select the device with the

newly assigned database file, the green Database button is enabled. Push it to conveniently select the parameter you want to map from a list, „ “



instead of looking up its parameters in the manual.


_MENU > Devices_
Open the database and
look for your target device.


_MENU > Mapping_
Press the Database
button and select the
parameter you want to
assign.

## **Snapshots**

Snapshots are used to _save and recall_ the state of _rotary positions, buttons on-off status and fader positions_ .

A project contains 20 banks with 20 snapshots each.


They can contain _all of Drop s control elements or only a subset’_ . Snapshots enable you to automatically turn multiple control elements at once, which

would not be possible with only two hands. You can also execute multiple snapshots at once and combine them.


In addition, snapshots can also _hold up to 8 MIDI messages_ that are being sent as one-shot messages when the snapshot is executed. These MIDI

messages can also contain _program change_ and _bank select_ messages to tell your devices to switch patterns or load the next preset.


Snapshots can be recalled in Jump mode or in Drop mode, _or both_ at the same time. In Jump mode, snapshots are executed with an adjustable fade

time, that can also be zero for immediate execution. In Drop mode, snapshots are scheduled in advance to be executed at the end of the current

playback cycle, which marks the point where the current 1-32 bar pattern ends and the next one begins. In Drop mode, execution takes place with

no fade time, and also automatically ends ongoing Jumps, resulting in a timed and immediate change in music.


With this behavior, the combination of Jumps and Drops makes it easy to create a _buildup followed by a sudden drop_ in music, by virtually turning

parameters on up to eight hardware devices.


You can even go one step further and prepare sequences of Jumps and Drops in advance, using CHAIN mode. That way, you can prepare a song

arrangement using snapshots. Per project, there are 20 chains available with up to 64 snapshots each.


It is up to you as a musician, if and to what extent you want to use snapshots in your performance. _Here are some ideas_ :


  - Safety net when improvising and trying something risky .“ ”


  - Saving the hey, this sounds cool moment for later, while jamming around.“ ”


  - One-button solution for specific parameters, e.g. resetting effects across all devices.


  - One-button solution to load presets and switch patterns on multiple devices at once.


  - A third hand that can take care of a sub-task, so you can focus on the fun part .“ ” “ ”


  - Step through your song arrangements manually, one snapshot after another, or fully automated.

#### **Save snapshots**

To save the current state of the control elements, _push the SAVE button_ to enter save view. The control

elements will turn red or green, which indicates if the element will be saved into the snapshot or not.


GREEN: Selected, will be saved into snapshot. RED: Deselected, will not be saved into snapshot.


You can now change the state for each control element individually by turning, pushing or moving it.


To save the snapshot, simply press a snapshot button and you are done.

Selection groups help you to get the desired selection of control elements faster.


**GROUP**
The current selection is automatically stored inside one of eight groups. Use the two buttons to select
another group and make a new selection of elements. When you go back to the previous group, the
previous selection is also still there.
This is a fast way to switch between the selections you commonly use in your setup.

#### **Edit snapshots**

Edit existing snapshots. You can also enter MIDI messages that are sent as one-shots when the snapshot is executed.



**Move**
Move the selected snapshot to another button.
_Caution: Existing snapshots will be overwritten!_

**Color**
Change the color of the snapshot
by turning the menu encoder.

**Name**
Set a name for the snapshot, to
remember or in CHAIN mode.

**Values mode**
Instead of selecting and
deselecting control elements,
operation changes their value as
usual.

**Select mode**
By default, the EDIT view starts in
Select mode, described on the
previous page.


COPY snapshots



**MIDI message slots**
Activate up to 8 slots for different MIDI messages to be sent when the
snapshot is executed. Besides all other
common MIDI message types,
you can also enable _Program_
_Change and Bank Select_
messages here. If you send
them to a device running its
own internal sequencer, you
may want to set a Pre-Drop
delay in _MENU > Devices_,
so that the device receives
the message just before the
pattern ends. Entering a MIDI
message here is _similar to_
_MENU > Mapping_, except there
are no curves. Instead, a _fixed message value is sent every time_ .
Note On messages are immediately followed by a Note Off message.



Press _Shift + copy_ to select a source snapshot, then press the target snapshot. Press _Shift + copy_ again

to exit copy mode. Before pressing the target snapshot, you can select options for copying:


**Also copy MIDI slots** When active, also the MIDI message slots are copied.

**Create Auto name** When active, the target snapshot will get a default auto name.

Otherwise, the source name will be copied, too.

#### **Jump mode**



In the PLAY menu, you can set snapshot
quantization in JUMP mode.
The quantization also applies if you
trigger the snapshot remotely via MIDI.


In _MENU > Settings > Latest snapshot_ you
can enable, that the last snapshot
pressed keeps blinking softly. This helps
to remember when performing, how you
got where you currently are.
The blinking can be stopped by stopping
playback or by pressing the JUMP or
DROP button again, depending in which
mode you currently are.

_A Drop will end the Jump_
automatically.
That way, you can _create a buildup_

#### **Manual fade mode**

You can also use the small potentiometer to manually fade from the

current state to another snapshot or a combination of snapshots.


First, hold the Jump button while pressing the snapshot you want to


in _SETTINGS > multiple Jumps_ . Also here, if there is an overlap


pressed count.


Then, you need to move the potentiometer all to the left in order to

start the manual fade. As soon, as the leftmost position is reached,

you can fade towards the selected snapshots by turning the

potentiometer to the right. In the rightmost position, the snapshots

are faded in at 100%.


Button presses and MIDI data from the snapshot itself like program(

change messages, etc. are sent out as soon as the potentiometer)

leaves the 0% position. If you turn the potentiometer back to 0%,

only button values may change again, but snapshot-contained MIDI

messages will not be sent out again.


There are several ways to leave manual fade mode:


Push one of the bottom circle buttons to exit and leave the state as

it is or leave and reset to the original state we had before the fade.

Also, pushing the Jump button again stops the manual fade and

leaves the state as it is.


You can also schedule a Drop while the manual fade is in operation.

A Drop will also leave the manual fade.

## **Chain**

#### **Workflow**

The chain function allows you to _prepare and play back a series of_

_snapshots in a specific order_ . For example, if you are performing a

song that follows a fixed arrangement, you can set the snapshot

sequence here and then simply start the chain on stage instead of

firing off the snapshots manually.


The chain function offers a high degree of automation. Automating

an entire performance may not be the purpose of a live set, but you

can, for example, automate tedious parts of your performance and

outsource them to Drop so that you have your hands free for other,

more creative tasks.


There are a total of 20 chains, just as there are 20 snapshot banks. If

your performance is song-based, it can make sense to use one bank

and one chain per song. In _MENU > Settings_, there are two switches

to link banks to chains bidirectionally. Switching bank 1-20 may

automatically select the corresponding chain 1-20, and vice versa.


In chain mode, _snapshots are always fired exclusively_ . You can not

trigger multiple snapshots at the same time with a single chain entry.

However, _you can still manually fire snapshots during chain playback_

without stopping the chain.


Each chain can be up to 64 snapshots long. The snapshots in a chain

can belong to any of the 20 banks.


39



**Chain mode**

The snapshot buttons continue to work
normally during chain playback.
The SINGLE and REPEAT buttons are
blinking while a chain is playing.
Push _Shift + SINGLE_ or _Shift + REPEAT to_
_stop chain playback_, no matter in which
menu.


**Select**
Switch to a different chain 1-20. Switching
the chain will stop the currently active
chain. In _MENU > Settings_, there is a switch
to link chains and snapshot banks in both
directions, so that selecting a bank also
changes the chain and vice versa.


**Name**
You can give each chain its own name. E.g.
this could be the name of a song.


**Add +**
Push this button to add a snapshot to the
chain. Use the encoder to select the insert
position. Select Pause to insert a line “ ”
without firing a snapshot.


**Del -**
Push this button to delete the currently
selected entry.

**Circle buttons**
LED feedback is shown as usual red or blue

when snapshots are executed in Drop or

Jump mode.


**Playback marker**


After that, the cycle length will be 8 bars.


**Color**
Red = Drop, Blue = Jump, Grey = Pause



**Start Stop**
Use the upper left circle button to start chain playback at the current cursor position. You can also
start a chain in the middle instead of at the beginning.

**Snapshot name**
Use _Shift + edit_ to give
snapshots a name.


**Cycle length**
_“Stop“_
Do not continue chain
playback after this
snapshot s execution.’

_“- ”_
Leave the cycle length as
it is.

_“1-32 Bars ”_
Set the cycle length to
the specified length after
the snapshot was
executed.



For each snapshot, you can select Jump or Drop mode, as well as the fade time and the number of beats per cycle that follow. A progress bar and

LED feedback provide information about the playback position. Note: Entry GO 1 is a Drop and has set its length to ---, followed by BUILDUP “ ” “ ” “ ”

which is a Jump.


Note: When the _Drop length is set to -, a following Jump will start right after the Drop“ ”_ has been executed.

specified length is also the fade
time.




#### **Link Chains and Banks**





If you want to build your performance song by song and use one chain per song, it may also be useful to link snapshot banks and chains. For that

reason, there are 20 snapshot banks and 20 chains available per project.


In _MENU > Settings_, you will find two options for linking.


**Chain to Bank** When active, selecting another chain in chain view will automatically select the corresponding snapshot bank.


**Bank to Chain** When active, switching banks using the BANK button will automatically select the corresponding chain.


_Note: When switching chains, playback of the current chain is stopped._

## **Clock**

Drop s timing can be synchronized with other devices using MIDI clock or CV clock signals.’


**Source - CV clock** Drop syncs its own tempo to an incoming CV clock.
CV1 is always the clock signal, while CV2 can be used as a separate
trigger or gate signal. Clock speed and CV2 s usage must be set in ’
_MENU > CV In/Out_ .


**MIDI clock device**
Select the MIDI clock source device.


42



**Nudge BPM**
Use the upper blue buttons to temporarily speed
the tempo up or down. Only available if running on


When Drop sends MIDI clock to multiple other
devices, they may still get out of sync due to
different tempo change algorithms or accidentally
pushing the stop button on one device.
ReSync _quickly sends a Stop + Start_ message to all
MIDI clock outputs at the beginning of the next bar,
which is _usually inaudible and sets everything back_
_in sync_ .

#### **Clock delays**

Use clock delays to counteract different audio processing latencies of your connected gear.
If an instrument uses any kind of digital signal processing, it inevitably needs a little bit of time, also
called latency, from when e.g. a MIDI note message is received until the sound appears at the device s’
audio output. Manufacturers try to keep the latency as low as possible and if you play only one
instrument alone, you may not even notice. However, if you are running multiple devices in parallel,
different latencies may become audible.


**Left  clock delay in milliseconds–**
This delay time is independent of the tempo and _counteracts audio processing time_ .


**Right  clock delay in MIDI clocks–**
Only use this if you know what you are doing! Some DAWs and sequencers may not count the first
MIDI clock packet, or also count the start message as a MIDI clock. Use this, to counteract such
misbehavior.


Start off with all clock delays set to 0. Make sure, every device receives MIDI clock by Drop. Start playback and try to find out by ear if a device is
constantly playing a little bit ahead or after. It gets a lot easier if your devices play the same musical pattern, e.g. a short plucky sound every quarter.
If it is unclear, choose a reference device the one you expect to have the largest latency, let it play a pattern and unmute other devices one by one.( )
In our experience, hardware gear has very low latency in the 1-3 ms range. DAWs, however, can have significant and varying delay times, depending
on CPU load and audio settings.
_Positive delay times are preferred._ You can also apply _negative delay_ values. In this case, the clock will speed up a little bit after playback starts, until
the target pre-delay has been reached. So, playback will only be in sync after a short amount of time. For that reason, it is recommended to use
negative clock delays _only when necessary_ .

**Send MIDI clock while stopped**
If this option is activated, Drop will send MIDI clock signal also while playback is stopped. This option
should be enabled unless it disturbs a connected device. Sending MIDI clock while being stopped is
typical groovebox behavior. It constantly updates the tempo information on the receiving device, and if
the receiving device is smart enough, you get better timing precision right after starting the clock.

#### **Clock send enable**

On the next page, you can enable MIDI clock, transport and song position pointer output for every
physical port separately.


The default setting with the _two left checkmarks enabled is the right choice_ for most grooveboxes,
synths and DAWs send MIDI clock and transport .( )


**Left  MIDI Clock–**
Sends clock messages, which contain tempo information.


**Middle MIDI Transport–**
Sends start and stop messages, telling the connected device so start/stop playback.


**Right Song position pointer–**


**Clock to Sub-Ports of USB1/2**
MIDI via USB offers up to 16 virtual cables sub-ports .( )
Some MIDI USB devices may offer more than one subport, but need to receive MIDI clock only on a specific
one. Therefore, you can select to which sub-ports clock,
transport and song position pointer messages are being
sent and to which ones not.

## **CV Config**

Drop has two control voltage CV inputs and outputs each that can be used in different ways. All four CV ports are designed for voltages from 0-5V.( )

The outputs can create continuous voltages with a resolution of 12 bits 4096 steps . The CV inputs can read analog voltages with a resolution of 16 ( )

bits 65536 steps . To interface with a bigger modular system, you may want to use a Midi-to-CV converter( )

module.
