**Min / Max** Set the minimum and maximum output voltage range of the outgoing signals. Clock

signals are _rising edge per default_ . You can turn then into _falling edge by inverting Min and Max_ voltage.

Hold Shift while changing the parameter increases the step size, so the parameter changes faster.

#### **CV IN 1+2**

The CV inputs can either be used for clock signals or to trigger snapshots by external CV and gate signals.







|CV IN1|4PPQN (16th notes)<br>2PPQN (8th notes)|The incoming clock signal may have two different speeds.|
|---|---|---|
|**CV IN2**|_Without function_|With this setting, CV IN2 is ignored. When Drop is synced to<br>CV1 s clock input, playback will start with the first rising edge<br>’<br>at CV IN1 and stop playback when the clock signal stops after<br>a short timeout.|
||_Start Trigger_|Starts the clock when a trigger occurs at CV IN2.|
||_Start/Stop Gate_|Playback keeps running while the signal at CV IN2 is high and<br>stops as soon as the signal goes low.|
|**CV IN1+2**|_Jump Snapshot Trig_<br>_Jump Snapshot Select_||


This option is to connect the CV and gate output of a sequencer

to Drop s CV IN1 and IN2 to select and fire snapshots in Jump’

mode. The voltage at CV IN2 selects the snapshot, with the

voltage range from 0 to 5V is mapped to the 20 snapshots of the

current bank. When there is a rising edge at CV IN1, the

snapshot will be fired in Jump mode and the potentiometer

determines the fade time.

## **Remote**

Drop can also be remotely controlled via MIDI. You can link two or more Drops to jam with your band members and keep the same timing, or

expand the amount of available controls and connections, or use another MIDI device to control Drop s functions and embed it into a bigger setup.’

#### **Jump by MIDI notes**

Fire _snapshots from an external MIDI source_ like a sequencer or a keyboard. Only the 4x5 _snapshots of the current bank_ are affected. Snapshots are

fired in Jump mode, the fade potentiometer determines the fade time, and _PLAY > Quantization_ is used for timing.

|Mode|Col2|
|---|---|
|_Off_|Ignore notes.|
|_By Pitch_|The note number pitch determines chooses the snapshot. The Base Note and the<br>(<br>)<br>19 notes above are taken into account and are mapped to one snapshot each.<br>Notes exceeding that range are cropped and treated like the base note or the<br>highest note which is base note + 20. The base note corresponds to the lower left<br>snapshot and the highest note to the upper right snapshot. If the incoming note<br>does not exactly match a snapshot, the closest snapshot is selected.<br>_Use this mode to connect a programmable MIDI sequencer._|
|_Velo 1-20_|Only the base note is taken into account, other notes do not fire a snapshot. Choose<br>the snapshot according to velocity values 1-20. If the incoming note has a velocity<br>larger than 20, it is cropped and treated as velocity = 20. Also here, velocity = 0<br>corresponds to the lower left and velocity >= 20 to the upper right snapshot.<br>_Use this mode to connect a programmable MIDI sequencer._|
|_Velo 1-127_|Only the base note is taken into account, other notes do not fire a snapshot. The<br>snapshot is selected using the velocity value, where the full velocity range 1-127 is<br>spread evenly across snapshots.<br>_Use this mode to connect a MIDI trigger pad played by hand._|

#### **Receive and Send**

Many of Drop s functions can be remotely accessed via MIDI CC messages. There are different levels of depth’

tailored to real-world use cases that enable remote control.


You can use these settings to _link two or more Drop units_ to play along.


On both Drops, you need to add a Device for the other connected Drop and select a MIDI out and a MIDI

input port. In MENU > Settings, you can enable Receive and Send independently and thereby have a master


on both Drops. also make sure, that for each data direction, the MIDI channel is identical.


You still need to _setup MIDI clock separately_ .


**Jam Mode**


The intended use case for this mode is _playing a live set with a partner_ . Both have their own independent

setup with their own Drop as the master controller. Jam mode ensures that the Drop moment and the cycle

playback position are in sync across both setups. Besides that, each of you can play their own setup

independently.


**Dual Mode**


Drop, the receiver Drop will also switch the bank. Also, all snapshot related settings like quantization,

exclusiveness, or the fade time potentiometer are overwritten on the receiver Drop by the sender Drop.


**Full Mode**


_schedules and fires the same snapshot on the receiver_ Drop.

## **Grid Mode**

In Grid mode, Drop s button matrix can be used in two ways: As a mini keyboard ’

or a clip launcher with a connected DAW.

#### **Notes Mode**

Use the buttons as a small keyboard to send MIDI notes to a connected synth.


**Device** Select the MIDI device to which the MIDI notes should be sent.


**Channel** Set the MIDI channel on which the device receives the notes.


**Scale** Select the note scale in semitones that can be accessed with the

buttons. Exclude notes that do not match the note scale of your music.


**Velo** The velocity value of the Note-On messages sent out.

Use the four blue buttons to change the root note bottom left button in ( )

octaves or semitones. For better orientation, the root note buttons light up white.

Press and _hold shift_ to access a secondary layer with stop-all-clips button and _scene_

_launch_ buttons.


There are a few default MIDI channel uses when using Grid mode and a DAW:

Channel 1: Rotary encoder and fader, CC messages

Channel 2: Rotary and Track button push, Note messages

Channel 16: Clip launcher buttons and LED feedback, Note messages

#### **Bitwig setup**

Bitwig natively supports Drop as a controller from version 6 on and later. For earlier

versions, please download the file _Drop.bwextension_ from our website and move it

into Bitwig s extension folder ’ ( **[link](https://www.bitwig.com/support/technical_support/how-do-i-add-a-controller-extension-or-script-17/)** . )



**Launch scene**
Launch a scene with the
DAW s timing.’

**Launch scene as DROP**
The red buttons schedule a
scene launch for when the
playback marker reaches
the top and a DROP occurs.

**Stop all clips**
The white button is used
to stop all clips that are
currently playing.



Then in the Bitwig settings, select _Add Controller > Neuzeit Instruments > Drop_ . Optionally, enable Drop as the clock source in Bitwig and make sure,

that Drop also sends clock and transport messages to Bitwig.


The Bitwig extension is built to work with the default _PROJECT > DAW-Init_ settings and also ensures correct LED feedback. Besides selecting Drop as

MIDI input and output, the keyboard MIDI channel for Notes mode must be set in the _Keyboard Channel_ field. When changing the keyboard

channel, the extension must be switched off and on again in order to take it over.

#### **Ableton Live setup**

First, you need to _download the remote script files_ from our website and copy them

into the required folder on your computer.


These are the paths in which the downloaded .pyc files need to be placed. You may

need to create an empty folder Remote Scripts first, and also a subfolder Drop, in“ ” “ ”

which the .pyc files go. When done, restart Ableton Live for the script to show up.


_Windows folder:_ \Users\[username]\Documents\Ableton\User Library\Remote Scripts\Drop

_Mac folder:_ Macintosh HD/Users/[username]/Music/Ableton/User Library/Remote Scripts/Drop


This **[link](https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/209072009-Installing-third-party-remote-scripts)** on Ableton s website describes the installation of third-party remote scripts in more detail.’



**Control Surface**
Select Drop as the control surface and
activate its Input and Output when Drop is
connected to the computer.
_If Drop does not show up, the script files_
_are not in the right place yet!_


56



**In**
Activate _Remote_ to map Drop s control ’
elements to parameters in Ableton Live.
Activate _Track_ to forward MIDI notes from a
Merger to Live s MIDI tracks.’
Activate _Sync_ if you want to use Drop as the
master clock for Ableton Live.


**Out**
Activate _Remote_ to receive MIDI feedback
from Ableton Live.
Activate _Track_ to receive MIDI notes from
Ableton Live s clips and forward them ’
through Drop s Mergers.’
Activate _Sync_ if you want to use Ableton as
the master clock for Drop.
Set _Song_ as MIDI clock type if you want
Drop to beatjump when jumping in
Ableton s timeline, otherwise use ’ _Pattern_ .

|Options|Col2|
|---|---|
|**Brightness**|The overall LED and display brightness. Stored globally, not per project.|
|**Default Color**|When activating a new control element, this is the default LED color.|
|**Keyboard layout**|Tells if a connected USB keyboard has QWERTY or QWERTZ layout. Stored globally.|
|**Moving shows**|When moving a control element, the display can also_show the name and/or the value_ of the control element. When playing<br>in bright sunlight, the display s readability is usually better than the LEDs.<br>’<br>Note: You can give each control element its own name, so when coming back to a project after some time it is easier to<br>remember everything. To speed up naming and menu navigation, you can_connect a USB keyboard_ to Drop.|
|**Latest Snapshot**|When executing a snapshot in Jump mode, Drop mode, or by editing it, its button keeps blinking softly. This helps to<br>remember the last action during a performance and to keep track of everything.|
|**MENU but returns**<br>**to root**|In some menus, the MENU button is also used as a back button. When this option is activated, the MENU button takes you<br>back all the way to the root of the menu, otherwise it may only take you back one step. Deactivate this option if you feel<br>familiar with Drop.|
|**Multiple Drops**|When activated, multiple snapshots can be combined to be_scheduled simultaneously as a Drop_. If two snapshots share the<br>same control elements, the snapshot you press last has priority.<br>When deactivated, only one snapshot can be_exclusively_ scheduled as a Drop.|
|**Multiple Jumps**|When activated, multiple_snapshots can be combined in a Jump_. If two snapshots share the same control elements, the<br>snapshot you press last has priority. Adding a snapshot to an ongoing Jump will re-start the fade time. When a Jump is<br>already fading, you can also deselect snapshots from the fade one by one.<br>When deactivated, only one snapshot can be_exclusively_ be used for a Jump at a time.|

#### **Test mode**

Push the Test button to enter a test mode in which you can verify that Drop s hardware works correctly. Turn the encoder to switch pages. Test “ ” ’

mode allows you to see if all LEDs work as expected, lets you test all push buttons, encoders and faders and lets you test CV and TRS inputs and

outputs.


_Note: In test mode, CV and MIDI will not work. Test signals (0-5V ramp) and test messages are sent over all CV and TRS outputs which are not valid_

_MIDI data._

## **Project**

#### **Management**

In MENU > Project you can save, recall, create, rename and delete projects. Also, there are options to

initialize a new project for either DAW-only use or hardware device use, as well as a purge function to help

you clean up a cluttered project.


Projects are stored on Drop s Micro SD card in the /Projects folder. The file format is .json JavaScript object’ (

notation which means that it is a human-readable format that is open for future editing in a web)

environment.


You can also navigate subfolders inside the /Projects directory if you need to, but you need to create them

on the SD card using your computer.

|Save Project|Store the current project. Push the NEW+ button to create a new project or select an existing project name. Leave<br>the name as it is to overwrite the existing file or change the name to save a second version of the project.|
