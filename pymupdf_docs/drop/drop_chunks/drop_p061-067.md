#### **Hardware Initialization**

**Clean Init** Use this as a starting point for a setup with other hardware devices.


With this initialization function, all control elements and devices are deactivated

and reset, so Drop s control surface will be dark at first. ’


This is a clean starting point for a setup with _devices with a MIDI mapping table_ .

This applies to most synths and grooveboxes, so the device expects a specific

message for each parameter and all mapping is done in Drop. You should only

activate the control elements you actually need and set up the right MIDI

messages the receiving device expects.


If you have a _MIDI device that has its own internal MIDI learn function_, you should

still start off with an empty project. Then, just activate the needed controls and a

MIDI slot and stick with the default unique message type and message number.

Then, use the receiver s learn function.’


_Starting with a blank project is usually the best way to create a clean and_
_reactive setup with no MIDI message overhead._

#### **Default mapping**

This is the default mapping applied to each control element when using the functions Purge Project, Create New, DAW Init or Clean Init. Except from

DAW Init, the control elements may be disabled, but the MIDI messages are already set up under the hood, so you only need to activate the control

element when you need it.


Pink MIDI CC message, channel 1.

Blue MIDI Note message, channel 2.

Green MIDI Note message, example. Slots are deactivated and snapshots do not send out MIDI by default. But the note numbers are already set up

in the background. Note numbers 0-119 are applied, repeating after bank 7 starting with note number 0 again.


_Note: Some CC numbers are missing (CC #0, #6, #32, #38, #97, #98) as they are used for NRPN and Bank Change messages. By skipping those_

_numbers, the mapping does not intersect._

## **Troubleshooting**

Setting up Drop is all about making two MIDI devices talk to each other the right way. This may not always be straight forward, so this is a list of

common pitfalls and tips.


**What messages does Drop actually send/receive?**


Use the MIDI Monitor in the PLAY view to see what messages are going in and out of Drop at each MIDI port. Drop keeps a history of the past

messages. You can stop recording and scroll through the history to see what is going on.


**MIDI TRS type A or B**


When using MIDI over TRS, there are historically two standards type A and B where the tip and the ring of the jack are physically switched. A

receiving device may only understand one of the two types. Drop has a switch next to each MIDI Output TRS port to select either type A or B.


MIDI TRS to DIN adaptors also have one specific type A or B. If the wrong type is selected, the outgoing MIDI DIN signal does not work.


Drop can receive both type A and B on its input. The switch only affects the outgoing signal.


**MIDI USB must be class-compliant**


When using a MIDI device over USB, communication only works if the connected device supports class-compliant MIDI. Unfortunately, this is not the

case for all MIDI devices. If your device needs a _driver to be installed, it is not class-compliant_ and can not be used over USB with Drop. Use TRS MIDI

instead. During our tests, we found that some Roland and Boss devices do not support class-compliant MIDI.


Drop may also show an error message and offer you to save a Log file. Before sending us the Log file, please double-check if the device really is

supposed to be class-compliant.


**USB sub-port**


MIDI over USB uses sub-ports, also known as cable ID or virtual cable. The index ranges from 1 to 16. Per sub-port, another 16 MIDI channels can be

sent. Most devices only use one cable ID, but some may also offer multiple ones. Make sure you set up the right one in MENU >Devices or simply try

to find the one that works. The number of sub-ports the device offers is only shown when the MIDI device is connected.

**MIDI channel**


Make sure the channel on which Drop sends MIDI messages corresponds to the channel on the receiving device. Drop uses channel numbering 1-16

as the MIDI specification says. However, some devices may use a numbering scheme from 0-15 which is the actual data transmitted in the protocol.


**USB hubs can not be used.**


USB hubs are not supported by Drop. You can only use one direct USB connection from Drop to the device.


**MIDI port selection in** _MENU > Devices_


The MIDI Input and Output ports selected in _MENU > Devices_ are simply the ports where your device is physically connected to and have nothing to

do with routing MIDI from device A to device B.


If you want to route incoming MIDI notes from a keyboard or sequencer to a synth, the synth does not necessarily need the MIDI Input port

enabled. Instead, set up a second Device for the keyboard or sequencer and use the Merger function of the synth Device to set up the routing.


You only need to enable the MIDI Input port, if

- your device is a keyboard or a sequencer

- your device is a groovebox or synth that sends MIDI feedback when turning its knobs and you also want to use it in Drop

- your device is a groovebox or synth that sends MIDI feedback when turning its knobs and you want to use MIDI Learn to set up the mapping.


**Do not ignore warnings**


Throughout all mapping and setup menus, Drop may show a ! warning sign wherever it detects a misconfiguration. For example, when a mapping “ ”

is applied to a Device that does not have an output port set, a warning sign is shown. Warning signs usually mean, that messages are not being sent

or received.


**Enable MIDI-Feedback only if really needed**


Each of Drop s control elements can react to incoming MIDI messages and be remotely turned, moved or pushed that way. The intention is that ’

when you turn the mapped control on the receiver, the mapped control element on Drop also changes its value.


If the control element uses more than one slot and also sends messages to other devices, these messages are also sent when MIDI feedback is

received.

For example: You macro-mapped a rotary knob to Synth-A s filter on Slot 1 and Synth-B s volume on Slot 2. The rotary knob s MIDI feedback is ’ ’ ’

enabled and set to Slot 1. Assuming that Synth-A sends back MIDI when turning its filter knob, the rotary control thereby changes its value. To avoid

a potential MIDI feedback loop, Drop will not respond by sending MIDI over Slot 1 on which it also receives incoming MIDI feedback from Synth-A,

however it will still send MIDI out to Slot 2 so that Synth-B changes its volume.


**Remote TX and RX accidentally enabled**


Drop offers the option to be remotely controlled via MIDI which can be enabled in _MENU > Remote_ . This function is also intended to link several

Drop units, which is why Drop can also send the same MIDI messages out, such as the selected cycle length, quantization settings, beatjumps, and

many more. Besides that, incoming MIDI notes can be used to trigger snapshots remotely, e.g. from a MIDI keyboard or sequencer.


Only enable the Remote functions if you really need them, otherwise incoming MIDI messages may change settings in Drop without you even

noticing. The same way, Drop may send MIDI messages without intention.


**MIDI feedback loops**


A MIDI feedback loop is caused when a device receives a message which causes it to respond or pass it through and send another message back,

which in turn causes the other device to also respond with a MIDI message again. By that, both devices end up sending messages back and forth in

a loop and the whole MIDI communication gets stuck. Loops can also occur across three or more devices.


Drop already has some built-in features to prevent MIDI feedback, but it is still possible to create them.


There is no allround solution on how to prevent MIDI feedback loops, but the MIDI Monitor in the PLAY menu may help to find out what is going on.


**Optimize for performance**


It is good practice to make sure only the messages which are actually needed pass through your cables. This reduces errors and improves latency.


- Use the Merger s message filters and only enable what is actually needed.’

- Send MIDI clock only to the ports and devices which actually make use of it. Also, double check if the receiving device needs and understands

Start/Stop and Song Position messages and disable it when not needed.

- Disable all control elements that are not used. If an unused control element is part of a snapshot, it will send unnecessary MIDI data when

executing the snapshot.
