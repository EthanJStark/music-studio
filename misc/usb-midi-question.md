I'd want to rule out the possibility of using midi-over-usb for any of the current connections listed as DIN connections,
since they add setup complexity (e.g. playing live or jamming at a friend's place)

Today, midi over usb has generally worked well for me, but I haven't tested any rPi <> [any of my other gear] connections
over midi usb
